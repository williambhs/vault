Price elasticity of demand (PED)

calculated w/: (% change in qd/%chance in price)
If PED > 1 - demand is sensitive to price changes, if <1 demand not very sensitive - for example, essential goods that people will buy regardless like food have low price elasticity

Income elasticity of demand (YED)

calculated w/: (% chance in qd/%chance in income)
measures responsiveness of qd to changes in income - for example non essential goods will

essential goods = inferior goods, normal goods = luxury goods that are more elastic

however, some exceptions - for example, rice is essential and generally a normal good, but some rich people might be able to buy higher quality rice

normal goods are goods where demand increases as income increases, inferior goods are goods where demand decreases as income increases

ped focuses on price changes while yed focuses on income changes - ped usually negative but yed can be positive/negative depending on type of good

positive income elasticity = demand up as income goes up
negative income elasticity = demand down as income up

inferior goods have negative income elasticity, luxury goods see a more than proportional increase with positive income elasticity and some normal goods see an increase as well, however it's less than proportional to the increase

xed - cross price elasticity of demand = (%change in qd a) / (% chance in price of good b)

xed > 0 - substitutes, can replace each other
xed < 0 - complements, goods used together
xed ~ 0 - goods are unrelated
