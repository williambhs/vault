Shifters of demand:
1 - prefs/tastes
2 - # of consumers
3 - price of subs/complements
4 - income
5 - expectations

Shifters of supply:
1 - price of resources/availability
2 - tech
3 - subsidies/taxes/gov regulations
4 - # sellers
5 - change in future expectations

Double Shifts:
when you shift both demand and supply, either the price/quantity will be indeterminate
how to tell which one?
draw shifts separately, than combine the results

ex. gum - price goes up, demand goes up - what happens to price/quantity?
when price goes up, price goes up (obviously) and supply goes down
when demand goes up, price goes up, quantity indeterminate
