see : [[02 - DS - O - Stack]]

not like an arraylist - all action occurs at one end, the top of the stack
push to add something, pop to take something off

LIFO, last in first out

poorly designed but you should still use - don't use list methods as well

has a built in toString method

Queue - like standing in line at a grocery store - anything added gets added to the end
FIFO - first in first out
add/remove methods are called add and remove - remove removes from the "end" or whatever you added first

Implement with Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>() 
^yeah kinda weird..?
