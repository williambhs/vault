How much resistance an object exhibits when its velocity changes
Greater mass = less acceleration when force applied because f = ma

Scalar and an inherent property which means it doesn't change based on what surrounds it

Distinction between mass and weight - weight changes based on gravitational force, for example you weigh different amounts on earth vs on the moon but your mass is the same
