Law of inertia - if an object is not interacting w/ other objects you can identify a reference frame where its acceleration is zero

tldr: no external force = object won't change its state of motion (be that at rest or a constant velocity in one direction or the other)

this reference frame = intertial frame of reference - any refererence frame with constant velocity relative to the intertial frame is also inertial. 
however, if you are accelerating, that frame becomes a noninertial reference mrame
