**Something else kinda important:** N = newton - the force that when acting on a 1 kg object produces an acceleration of 1
1 N = 1 kg * m/s^2

Newtons third law - if two objects interact the force exerted by object on on object 2 is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force object 2 exerts on object 1

Action force + reactional force - for example if you drop a basketball, the earth is exerting a force on it, just like the basketball is exerting a force on the earth - however the earth has a huge mass and thus the amount it moves is negligible
