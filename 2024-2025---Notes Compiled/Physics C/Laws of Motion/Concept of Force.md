For an object to accelerate - net force cannot be zero
Thus - if net force = 0, velocity of an object is constant and its acceleration must be 0
When object has constant velocity -> called "equilibrium"

Contact forces - physical contact between two objets
Field forces - no physical contact but still exert a force ie. gravity

Use vector addition to get net force
