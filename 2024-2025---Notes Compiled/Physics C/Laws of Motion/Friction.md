When an object is in motion either on a surface or in a medium - it faces friction called friction 

Force that stops an object from moving = force of static friction - if pushing an object, as long as it isn't moving Fs = F, as F increases so does Fs (the force is proportional)

If force exceeds FsMax -> force of kinetic friction 

F - Fk = acceleration - if f = fk then acceleration will be equal to 0 and thus the object will move at constant speed
