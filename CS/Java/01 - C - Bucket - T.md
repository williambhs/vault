Often referred to as a concept rather than a formal data structure - in Hashtables a bucket refers to a slot that contains one or more key value pairs
Used to handle collisions - because different keys can produce the same hash code a bucket handles collisions. Buckets correspond to indexes in the array and can store more than one pairs.
