Not truly random - but useful anyway to generate pseudorandom numbers - Math.random() generates a double in between 0.0 and 1.0. 

Another Java feature is importing java.random, a class included in the java.util package - first create a random object with the syntax:

Random r = new Random();

random has a next int method - ie r.nextInt(x), returns a number between 0 inclusive and random exclusive

// practice problem
generate random num 50-99 inclusive that's odd
int n = rand.nextInt(A) * B + C;

1-49 if c is 50
