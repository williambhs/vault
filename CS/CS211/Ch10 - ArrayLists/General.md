see: [[02 - DS - O - ArrayList]]
arraylist - dynamic

must be imported

ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();

easier to think about ArrayList<String> as one object - an arraylist of strings

Java introduced the diamond operator so you don't need String inside the second diamond operator ->
Arraylist<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
