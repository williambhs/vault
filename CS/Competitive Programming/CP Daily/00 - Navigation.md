**Goal is to do 2-5 leetcode problems daily while learning concepts - try to do more on weekends.**

Update as of 7/1/24 - going to include some Kattis/USACO problems as well to get better at CP. Kattis problems will be marked with a K - since the problem descriptions are usually significantly longer than LeetCode problems I'll just add my solution to Obsidian.
USACO problems will be marked with a U followed by the division - B is bronze, S is silver, and G is gold. For example, UB - Easy would be the equivalent of USACO Bronze - Easy, US - Hard would be USACO Silver - Hard, and so on.
