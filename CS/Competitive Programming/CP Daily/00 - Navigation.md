**Goal is to do 2-5 leetcode problems daily while learning concepts - try to do more on weekends.**

Update as of 7/1/24 - going to include some Kattis problems as well to get better at CP. Kattis problems will be marked with a K - since the problem descriptions are usually significantly longer than leetcode problems I'll just add my solution to Obsidian.

**Total Problems Completed:** 26
**Easy:** 11
**Medium:** 15

<h1> Day # - Difficulty - Status - Problem Name </h1>
