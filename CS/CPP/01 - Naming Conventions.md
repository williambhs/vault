Some basic rules:
-can't contain symbols (besides underscore) or spaces/tabs
-can't include keywords
-can't start with a number
-c++ is CASE SENSITIVE - means you can have different variables with the same name if the capitalization is different

general good practice:
variable name should be all lowercase
function names should start with lowercase
only start with uppercase for user-defined types - covered later

if the variable name/function is multiword, convention is either camelCase or snake_case 

sometimes people use a mix of the two - underscores/snake_case used for variables and intercaps/camelCase used for functions.

typically don't start your function name with an underscore.
