<h1> Problem Description </h1>


-----
Not sure why this is a medium problem, going to create an arraylist - first turn the string s into a character array, then use the ascii table - if the character is a letter add it to a temp string, then if the character is not a letter add the temp string to the arraylist of strings. At the end add all the strings in the arraylist to a string with a space in between.
