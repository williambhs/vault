Stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. Good to have an understanding of XML first.
The advantages of using SVGs is that they can be created and edited with any text editors, are pure XML, don't lose quality.

Because SVG is written in XML all elements must be properly closed. XML is also case sensitive so all SVG elements and attributes should be lower case.
