Browsers are very forgiving - even if something goes wrong according to the HTML specification you might be able to get away with messing stuff up
Run your webpage through the W3C Validator to tell if your page is valid - https://validator.w3.org/
To use - go to file upload and open the .html folder.

Because some older browsers aren't updated as frequently, some elements don't function correctly. It's important to check which browsers are being used, and whether or not an element you're using is compatible. Below are useful links to do the following.
[Browser Statistics (w3schools.com)](https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/default.asp) - view popular browsers
[Can I use... Support tables for HTML5, CSS3, etc](https://caniuse.com/) - check browser compatability
