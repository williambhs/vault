Some characters are "reserved" in HTML and thus must be replaced with entities - for example, if you want to type a less than or greater than sign, HTML will interpret it as starting or closing a tag, so you need to use the HTML entity "&lt;" or "&gt;" to replace them. Ironically, the ampersand itself requires the use of an entity to type.
Another common use for entities is to type characters that are otherwise not found on the keyboard.
