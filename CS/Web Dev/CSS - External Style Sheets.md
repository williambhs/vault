Internal/inline styling - using the < style > element 
External style sheets are preferable when using a style sheet that's meant to apply to an entire website
Create a css file called style.css 
Then, use the link tag on any pages you want to use the stylesheet on in the head - 
For example, < link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" >
