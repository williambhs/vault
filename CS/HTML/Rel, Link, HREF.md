Link tag - wrapped by the head tag, used to define a relationship between the document and an external resource - for example
< link rel = "icon" href = "styles.css" >

rel = relation and means the relation - above it would mean the relation is that the resource the document is being linked to is an icon

href - stands for hypertext REFerence - its function is to specify the URL of the linked resource, defining the destination for hyperlinks/links. 
The href attribute can also be used in conjunction with the ID attribute to allow you to go to certain parts of a page - this can be done by:

1 - assign the id element to an attribute - for example < h1 id = "section1">Section 1< h1 >
2 - use a hashtag and href - < a href="#section1">Go to Section 1< /a >

the href will redirect you to the first header with id section 1.
