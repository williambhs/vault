If reading theory - either timesuck or an out 
However - if you think theory can be the 2AR - don't read a bunch of shells, or else 1] you have to debate a doc and 2] arguments can be cross applied

For example - no alt advocacies - this shell is stupid BUT the counterinterp will probably also be stupid - go for huge fairness first push and if competing interps is conceded, gg - their counterinterp will solve zero of your predictability offense because it'll just be like "one alternative!" which is also just defense

Not just a time suck - also a prep time skew -  unfamiliar arguments, you can spam 4-5 shells and then just read setcol, they'll waste a lot of prep and you can just give a setcol  2nr - forces critical thinking because they can't just spam blocks

You can actually lean into the stupidity of the shell - "this is a really stupid shell but you're voting aff because they have done something even dumber - voting for them is worse than voting for me at this point because they have no reasonability claim and only defense"

FYO's - abuse judges - they don't want to look stupid - you ironically want to spend less time on the lbl sometimes because it makes them look like they have more defense

View the 2ar like you're explaining to the judge how offense/defense paradigm works - "look, they have conceded competing interps - this is why you should vote aff"

Look up - don't be on the doc - paper 2ars LOL
