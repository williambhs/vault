**Lowe - Heterogeneity, Hybridity, Multiplicity**
Dominant/minority binary - doesn't work 
Lowe wants to get away from oppositional structure 
Bad form of politics as:
1 - self imposition - Lowe thinks this means you have accepted the hegemonic worldview, similar to Hegel's dialectic - the master requires the recognition of the slave and thus the slave comes to realize his own independence
2 - you may become that form of politics and seek to become that dominant power
