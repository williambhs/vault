K affs - two parts:
1 - kritik
2 - aff 
(wow who could've guessed)

Kritiks something about the topic, while simultaneously affirming something that they say is good

**Why strategic?**

People suck at responding - just get good at responding to cap and T and it's gg (perm + impact turns are your best friend here) - some teams might be creative with stuff like psycho but pretty bad in general

**How to cheat?**

Start with a theory - develop link arguments to the topic, wahoo you have an aff
However - you're recycling backfiles so many common arguments will apply, ex. you can't say "not our baudrillard" because well, it probably is
Instead - start with the 2AC (1AR) and work backwards - doesn't work as well in LD but works much better in CX 
Instead - you should write an aff based on topic specific lit that has a specific theory of the world - you should have a very specific topic angle 

Should have multiple sources of offense - otherwise if you just say state bad they impact turn it for like half the 1nc and you lose

**How to write counterinterps?**

1 - role of the aff - an interp of what debate ought to be
2 - certain debaters should not be forced to do x - Nato aff would be an example of this - offense is that language is not universal, linguistics are thus not predictable 
3 - debate it like T - counterdefine usfg, etc.

Also prepare for the cap K - you should never lose because there is never a unique source of offense - basically zero innovation in what they say
three situations when the 2nr is cap - the 1AR undercovers, the team is a hack, or the judge likes it

To beat the cap K - impact turn the cap K because teams have no idea how to answer it - they can answer microptx good, etc. - verticalism bad (most alts are) and humanism bad

Also - framework - useful vs K affs because you can explain what the role of debate should be - becomes a theory argument - basically becomes a fiat K - the alt imagines things, that is bad 

**2AC (1AR) Writing**

Prioritize offense - you need an overview and have to explain threshold for solvency (this is what we have to win to win the debate - we don't have to solve everything, just x) - impact turn the 1NCs framing

**Answering Spam**

Conditionality - usually not fairness unless you aren't saying fairness bad - gish gallop = proliferates bad arguments - antithetical to critical education because it incentivizes spamming shit and just seeing what sticks

**KvK debates**

framework, impact calc, offense

academy - academy is good, exclusion, debate is key, uq/alt solvency press
