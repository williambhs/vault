Biggest afropessimist in debate
Orlando Patterson - developed the theory of social death

**Three pillars**

Natal Alienation
Middle passage - alienated black people - this process stripped black people of familial lines. An example is how black people have white last names - when they were transferred they BECAME slaves as it severed their ties from where they came from which turned them into slaves

Gratuitous Violence
Violence without reason - process through which violence occurred but there's no reason that violence occurred
Some people like to understand slavery through an economic sense - not racialized because people just wanted to make money
Wilderson would say whipping saves to death would not be a viable economic strategy because if you had slaves you probably want them to work

General Dishonor
Exists a racialized ordering - exclusionary of blackness - the constant distancing of blackness away from civil society - during the womens suffrage movement white women were trying to get the right to vote - black people worked with them but many movements distanced themselves from black women and tried to justify only giving the vote to white women and not black women

**Libidinal Economy**

Two parts - people both love/hate blackness - explained through philia/phobia
Philia - cultural appropriation of things like rap
Phobia - justifications for police killing
Libidinal desires all stem from psychoanalysis and thus requiring an understanding of it to win your ontological thesis

The stage - Wilderson imagines civil society as a play - even if you change the ordering of the actors or move them around Wilderson says antiblackness is the stage the play is performed on which means it's not just "x policy" is antiblack but rather antiblackness is intrinsic to society - this means reforms aren't able to "solve" antiblackness
The more we invest into thinking beyond slavery the worse it is as it's a form of cruel optimism

Extra judicial violence - the process through which the state is able to maintain violence that exists outside of the law/commit violence for people who follow the law
Two examples:
1 - Philando Castile - some dude who was just driving - cop randomly decided to shoot him - cop got off without being charged
2 - drone warfare program - we can kill anyone in 30 minutes with the push of a button - an example of extra judicial violence because the government shouldn't be murdering people

Ruse of analogy - the process of understanding other forms of violence creates a ruse - for example when non black people try to emphasize - Wilderson says antiblack violence is so irrational nonblack people can't attempt to rationalize how bad it is

**What is there to be done?**

At the end of red white and black - Wilderson doesn't describe a solution but rather just says we should "burn down the world" - impact turns reform and those trying to cling to civil society - that means the only solution is to create a new world by ending the current world
What he means is vague because he would "probably get swatted" but he essentially means a revolution
