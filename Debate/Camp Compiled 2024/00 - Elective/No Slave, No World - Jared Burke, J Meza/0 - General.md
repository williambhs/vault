**William Du Bois**

At this time - most of Africa was colonized - Du Bois wanted Africa to band together/unite

He writes about the color line, which refers to the equator - the Global South is maintained through colonization - his critique is that the North/South have created a dichotomy where all the resources are in the North

Since the African slave trade - Africa a point of destabilization, relentlessly colonized - Du Bois advocated for self determination

**Malcom X**

Begins with the idea of black nationalism - black people can create better communities that don't give money to white people
Malcolm X had the idea that you should stay within the black community - if you left you would be giving your money to the white people - wanted to keep the concentration of black power in the community
Talked about black nationalism as self help

**Fanon**

"The black man is only black in relation to the white man - has no ontological resistance in the eyes of the white man"
A jumping off point for Wilderson who uses it to describe the process of ontology, which, to Fanon is the process of who exists in the world
Phobia - process through which white people have an implicit bias/libidinal drive to dislike white people
Fanon says it is engraved in our psyche and thus unchangeable
Hypervisibility - the idea that there's a hyperfixation on black people - for example Hillary Clinton describing black people as super predators
