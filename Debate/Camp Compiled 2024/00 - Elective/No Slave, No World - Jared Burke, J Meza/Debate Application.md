Good K debating = good case debating

Agathangelou - kritik of the international system 
Ontology debate - important but do not think of it as if you win ontology you win
Ontology = uniqueness for your link argument - higher risk of ontology = greater risk your link argument is true
Ontology determines the direction of the link 

Built in answers to extinction o/ws - afropess has a good analysis of how extinction does not matter in the process of ontological antiblackness
Black people already living in extinction

The alternative is pretty simple - 
1 - basically just to reject the aff and instances of antiblack practices - perform an unflinching paradigmatic analysis and if the aff is antiblack they should reject it to move towards the end of the world
2 - aarons ev - an act of self abolition - good if you're a nonblack debater going for pess as it says how nonblack people should exist in the revolution
3- farley ev - view it as the setcol alternative - don't think about how or what plan or what blueprint we have, we just need to do it  - you can also read the healy ev which doesn't use the term burn it down which makes you less susceptible to common indicts 

every afropess 1nc should have brady 15 ev - black scenario planning
explains what would happen if afropess is false - says even if pess is false it's a good metric for how we should understand the world - by trying to analyze whether it's capital t true it removes its political potential

brady and murillo ev - says we should surrender to blackness - written in the context of asian coalitions with antiblackness - ev says that's bad and that antiblackness is the first priority that should be understood - both framing ev and an answer to the perm

phil interactions - afropess thinks there is no such thing as a rational subject as people have libidinal drives 
if answering pess with kant - mills has a book called black radical kantianism - possible because in kantianism there is the idea of critical self reflection - reevaluate the way in which we think about things

AT: NB pess bad - there is no alternative - there are ways in which it's phillic and fetishized which is bad
however - in the general baseline sense wilderson get the question why he teaches white people afropess - it's not an identity argument but rather about a structural argument about how antiblackness is rooted within civil society and about how the affirmative worsens that by protecting civil society - even if we cannot understand the gravity of it we can still implicate it
if they tell you "read setcol" - that's antiblack too
