Types of Asian Identity Affs:

1 - Speculative Fiction - interacts well with fiat - affirm the aff happens in the world of "Bohr Maker" or "Akira" - the idea that the aff must happen in "this" world is the pathologization of melancholy

2 - Linguistics - affs that focus on the way that rhetorical spaces construct and exclude Asian American spaces for engagement - the way we understand English as the predominant way that we conduct a medium

3 - Assimilation Bad - affs that critique the assumptions of citizenship into how you engage the topic

On the negative - not as good because it's unfortunately basically just the fiat K - Asian American arguments come from the psychological level as opposed to the structural level

1 - threatcon - China rhetoric bad

2 - criticizing the rhetoric of competition - asian labor rendered as "cheap" and "efficient"

One of the best arguments AGAINST Asian American arguments is Setter Colonialism - a critique of the desire to belong as a means of displacing Indigenous groups - "belonging" and the drive for reconciliation are different - the goal of the aff are not equal entitlements but rather a rejection of that in the first place
