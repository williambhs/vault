**Asian American - two routes:**
1 - pan-ethnic identity - political term that groups ethnic groups together based on geographical location 
2 - racialized identity
1968 - some people were inspired by the black power movement and thus used the term as a moniker

Thus there are two ways to understand Asian American - the first is as a term used to describe yourself and the second is in a racialized manner where it is instead scripted onto you

Asian American as a racialized term became a stand in for what we now call a foreign other.
Elaine Kim - "Asian American, like its predecessor oriental, was created in the West from the need to make racial categorizations in a racially divided, or at least racially diverse society."

Imagined community - a community that is built around a horizontal comradeship despite never meeting any people in that group - even if you do not meet 99.99% of Asian Americans in the world you may still feel a sense of belonging and a sense of cultural relationship that goes beyond just proximity

The nation-state - nations are larger than just politics
Nation forms are ideologies that exist - America is not just a geopolitical identity but rather an idea - when you ask the question of what it means to be Asian American you ask the question of what it means to be American in the first place
Many Asian Americans were not seen as citizens when they came here - America is not just constituted by geographic proximity but rather an idea that is then formulated both against and through Asian Americans/other identity groups

**Timeline:**
1830 - 5 CN students arrive in America

1854 - People vs Hall court case that said CN testimony was irrelevant - significant because it made it seem like the way we trust Asian American's differed from how we trusted white people

1871 - LA lynching of 17 CN men/boys - was the largest group lynching at the time in American history - significant because throughout the 1800's there was always a trope of exclusion
One of the largest lynchings and was motivated because Asians were seen as too productive and efficient and thus outside of the category of the human - yet not discussed frequently

1882 - CN exclusion act  - you know what this is...

1898 - US vs Wong Kim - citizen soil test = the idea that if you were born in America you were a citizen - however even though Kim won the case, one of the judges dissented and said to be a citizen you had to be able to commit to American ideology - referenced the idea of the "Asian Invasion" - premised in the fear that too many Asian people would come to America and thus eradicate white existence
Ironically - this meant Asian Americans were unable to assimilate

1904 - San Francisco Chinatown plague quarantine - the idea that Asian Americans are contagion and thus associated with diseases - in Honolulu used controlled fires to burn down over 60% of their chinatowns

1927 - Lum vs Rice - excluded Chinese from white public schools (eventually overturned with Brown vs Board)

1942 - JP war relocation to detention - you know this one as well...

1982 - Vincent Chin killed for "stealing jobs" - accused for stealing jobs, his murderers getting away with no jail time
