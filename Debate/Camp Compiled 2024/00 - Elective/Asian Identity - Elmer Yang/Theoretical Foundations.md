Eng and Han were psychoanalysts and thus melancholia is very psychoanalytic in nature

Melancholia vs Mourning:
Melancholia - the inability to move on from a lost object
The lost object is something that you do not have and cannot gain - for Asian Americans the lost object is whiteness 

Mourning - the ability to let go of certain objects to invest in new ones 

Melancholy is a better way to understand Asianness as for many it is impossible to let go of the attachment to whiteness

The implication of this melancholic affect is what we describe as disassociation - while melancholia can reflect a "lost object", disassociation has no clean "lost object".

Melancholia as insurgent - Fanon informs the ways of how we use Asian American theory as insurgent
Liberal discourses of progress address loss through reconciliation - this is bad as it forces Asian figures to divest themselves, give up their grief and then assimilate into the nation-state - however they never want to truly assimilate them (see: [[Experience]])
Melancholy can also be the idea of cultural attachment 

The racial inhuman - being inhuman isn't always bad as it can trouble the very foundations of the telos of human progress - thus you're impact turning humanism and Western civilization
Jouissance - the idea that you can feel happy to belong but still feel alienated that you have not fully assimilated - Chang describes this as "traumatic enjoyment", the feeling that Asian-Americans feel happy at priveleges of being a citizen but face psychological alienation

Speculative Fiction - the current meta for Asian American arguments - tries to invert the tropes of Asian as technical
Race is not biological or cultural but rather negotiated - speculative fiction disrupts racial violence through aesthetics and ethics that imagines a world beyond race
