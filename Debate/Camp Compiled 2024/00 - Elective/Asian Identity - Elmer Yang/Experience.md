Two themes of Asianness- Alien, and Capital

Alien - Asian as a foreign other, not natural members of American society

Capital - Asian as anchored by labor, reduced to an object to be managed and culturally extracted

America needs Asianness to sustain forms of racial modernity - the idea of the model minority trope as a response to the civil rights movement showed that White Americans needed Asians 

Yellow Peril - related to the 1906 short story "The Unparalleled Invasion" which depicts China as a world power which threatened modern civilization
Important as it depicted China as a world power that threatened all of Western civilization

Fu Manchu, or the "devil doctor" represented many of these tropes - Asianness as something that is manipulative, contagious, and untrustable

**What is the orient?**

Orientalism is the idea that White America understands itself in counterposition to Asianness, or the yellow peril stereotype 
Important to understand that Orientalism is not trying to be accurate but rather just symbolically powerful
The media over-emphasizes the foreignness, exoticism, and danger of Asian Americans

**Techno-orientalism?**
The portrayal of Asian cultures as technologically advanced or futuristic to exoticize them
For example - Blade Runner portrays LA as a sprawling neon-lit metropolis with heavy influences from Asian culture 

Asianness reduced to robotic and machine-like - reduces the inhumanity of Asian labor to be expendable
Western progressive liberalism always grounded in the idea of the human
Another example of this is NoKo being represented by its nuclear weaponry as well as Asian economies being seen as rising tigers/dragons

The impact of techno orientalism is not just fearing Japan but rather the idea that Asianness has to be dismantled for White society to progress above it

**Ornamentalism**
Specifically talks about Asian femininity - Asianness/Chineseness are reduced to what they describe as the living dead - says that Asianness as an object to be exocitized is valuable but not alive - risks the capacity to interrupt white civil society

One example is 22 Lewd Chinese Women case - overcoded as prostitutes due to the way they dress which stopped them from immigrating
Continued sexualization of Asian women - in the case of the Chinese exclusion act, the vast majority of Chinese women that came over were part of hypersexualized prostitution 
Also meant Asian masculinity is feminized as the Asians who first migrated did traditionally female jobs such as being maids 

**Manifestations:**

1 - pollutive - scapegoating of Chinese CO2 emissions as well as 2007 lead panic when some Chinese toys were found to have some lead which then lead people to be afraid of all Chinese toys

2 - contagious - Asian as contagious exists far beyond covid - Kung Flu, China Virus, SARS - cultural factors 

3 - military - tropes of revisionism are overcoded via the yellow peril 


**Asian as Capital**
"The Asian subject... personfies abstract processes of value formation anchored by labor. From the economic efficiency associated with Asian racialization, denigrated as 'cheap' labor in the 19th century and valued 'efficient' in the 21st, Asian North American cultural production magnifies the manner through which Asians are aligned with 'abstract labor', a concept that anchors Marx's labor theory of value."

Abstract labor - the cultural significant of how we understand labor - capitalism dehumanizes workers by reducing diverse labors to an abstract quantity which alienates worker from their labor, products, and each other

Asian Americans as the "underbelly" - recruited for labor - this labor was important but undervalued and exploited, associated with "efficiency" and "cheapness" 

Important to note that liberalism needs Asianness to progress as white society needs this Asian labor
Catch 22 - white society needs Asianness to progress but never wants Asianness to be assimilated
