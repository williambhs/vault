Lerm ev - 
state of nature is bad - thus must use Hobbes

Thayer ev - 
darwinian dilemma = morality contingent on evolution - humans have evolved to be egoists, beneficial - we should submit ourselves to the sovereign because that solves

Lopata ev -
humans seek self-preservation and peace - says when people give up some of their rights and liberties to form a commonwealth people will achieve these forms of self-preservation as by giving up our own freedom the sovereign can protect its people against harm 

For the framework debate:

util collapses to egoism -> hobbes solves egoism
I know pleasure feels good for me but I don't know what feels good for you - that means I only have an obligation to seek out my own pleasure
We experience the world differently - thus morality under util becomes relative which means we don't have an objective standard

hobbes answers skep - the sovereign can say if something is moral or not which means the sovereign can just tell us what to do

For the contention debate:
President likes/doesn't like the plan - for example if Biden hates the plan and we make him do it anyway that's bad because we're imposing an obligation on him
On the aff - you could technically turn the NC if Biden likes the plan
Aspec - the plan uses the government - because the sovereign is the one doing the plan that makes Hobbes' theory more specific (this argument probably pretty shit)
