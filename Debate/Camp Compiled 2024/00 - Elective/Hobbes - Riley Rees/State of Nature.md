We see everyone as our enemies - we are all equal which makes us view everyone as threats
Hobbes describes it as brutish where we're all skeptical of each other - Hobbes offers the examples of security cameras and locking our doors at night - we're inherently distrustful of each other 
no one wants to live in the state of nature when everyone is fighting each other

Humans all realized this kinda sucked - decided to have a moment of initial democracy and elect a sovereign - for Hobbes this was the only true moment of democracy as after this every law was created by the sovereign

Commonwealth - the association of individuals under a sovereign
We maintain our commonwealth through "convenance" or agreements under the sovereign

You can leave the sovereign and form your own commonwealth if he sucks
in hobbes' book Leviathan - think of the sovereign as a powerful being that has control over everyone
