Strategy is twofold:
1 - framework - links must be unique to the plan and debates should be about the plan alone - arguments about the ethicality of fiat are irrelevant
the link is not unique because we imagine things all the time 
2 - fiat good - it is important to imagine solutions to different problems - the aff has other link turns/other pieces of offense that suggest the 1AC is ethical that can be weighed against the fiat K

Example framework interp: links must be unique and causal
You want the debate to be about their links, not your aff
win the debate on "they don't have a link" - your framework is inclusionary and only excludes certain links - doesn't say debates should always be centered around the plan

AT: They can just say a slur if links must be to the plan
No real adult is going to vote for a team who said a slur because there shouldn't be a debate about that

Fiat good - two parts
1 - win offense - various justifications ie. scenario planning good
2 - win defense - fiat is the only approach to debate writ large and doesn't exclude marginalized voices - how does the negative win without fiat, and what is the purpose of the topic if we only discuss whether it's ethical to discuss the topic at all

Why should it be offense if the aff fiated something? The neg links more since they've fiated the alternative as well
Uniqueness reasons - what would debate look like absent fiat? 

1AR should always say both fiat good and framework because otherwise the 2NR is 6 minutes of framework and you'll probably drop something

2AR approach depends on the best 2NR answers - if the 2NR is light on reasons fiat is bad or just spams a bunch of link arguments without explaining the impact well, the 2AR is better off going for fiat good/our performance is good - it solves extinction - fiat is valuable and we have other reasons the aff is not imperialist which is offense under their framework interp

Alternatively, if they're light on fairness - just go for framework but it's still nice to have a defense of fiat

Fairness - infinitely regressive - can critique anything because it's not clear what a research project is - aff solves if the neg can only draw link arguments from the plan 
Good for skills, makes us more critical thinkers, etc.
Fairness paradox - everyone relies on it and it's the only thing the ballot can solve
They can't solve their offense - it's not like if the judge votes neg the aff will rewrite the aff to exclude fiat

Common neg responses:

1 - no internal link/structural fairness non uniques
a - uniqueness for your procedural fairness argument 
b - no impact - no reason a novice should beat a top 10 team 
c - your offense outweighs - condo might be a little bad but infinite links is much worse

2 - their interp is more unfair - centers debate around solely the plantext - every debate becomes about process cps, word pics
a - empirically denied - people go for qpq, deterrence all the time
b - even if it does - still tied to a resolutional stasis which means they're more predictable

3 - fairness is not an impact, it's an internal link 
wrong - it's the only thing the ballot can solve, everyone cares about it, etc.

the reason you join debate is not to win but the reason you stay in debate is to keep getting better and win more 

Clash:

Clash = debate
Clash is good - we should debate

Tautological - the neg will say clash is good because debate is good but debate is only good because clash is good
Good because it's hard to impact turn - the negative will often only have defensive reasons

However - if they do impact turn it - "debate is truth over tech" - what does that even mean, basically just saying vote on vibes
The reason tech over truth is good is the reason clash is good - since we are here to debate we should engage each others arguments
The only way to have discussions about violent things in and out of debate is by centering them around a predictable stasis point

Fiat is good - three important things to note:

1 - you do not need to exclude their link to impact turn it - it's generally pretty easy to just defend fiat is good

2 - they want you to forget that you have offense elsewhere - do not forget about the other links that you have likely link turned or the other justifications for the 1AC being ethical - even under their interp the debate shouldn't be just about fiat - for example if they say security k and you say you desecuritize that is offense

Cooper ev (fiat good, see quick card) + 2AR:
 
2 - empathy- fiat includes perspectives from the global south - messed up to say x identity group doesn't care about reform/legal remedies

3 - turns their offense - necessary to understand real world + experimental politics are counter-hegemonic and recognize the value of other institutions outside of the usfg - thus we are not only considering the perspectives of the government - we ask ourselves how Iran reacts, how Iranian citizens react, etc.


When they rehighlight your stuff - it almost always says nothing, and when their interpretation is the the 1AC's performance must be ethical - you should say the reading of your aff is a performance

Kesselman's Hulsey ev - a critique of games - causes us to roleplay as other people because we desire control over meaning - we want to introduce fake threats to act out and control over things
Response - 
1 - we should care about existential risks 
2 - roleplaying good, debate is also not roleplaying - we don't think we're the usfg

They link more - the negs strategy is performative activism - makes them think they've solved the problem of fiat when all they've done is advanced a team one round at a tounrnament

Sullivan ev - you can't change the state but you can change the state of debate
Terminal impact is anxiety, depression
Internal link is often made analytically
The easiest way for the negative to win is by winning that 
1 - you said something racist
2 - they win an ethics da or that the judge should drop you for being racist

To answer this:
1 - defense - fiat is not a microaggression, you don't say black people have to be hopeful, and the ballot can't solve anyway which means they can't solve the state of debate - also win hope is not psychologically harmful

2 - offense - 
a - the belief that the ballot can solve racism from fiat is cruelly optimistic - in actuality the aff will double down and defend their impact turns and fairness even more
b - prevents punishment because everyone knows if they lose to fiat is a microaggression that is not a real argument - they will internalize it as a technical failure - instead the negative should go to tab or the equity officer which is a much harsher punishment
c - trivializes microaggression - makes actual instances of microaggressions link arguments
d - if it's only about the 1ac the 2nr can just be racist

AT: that framework block everyone reads
1 - plan focus = 10s statement - hold them accountable 
wrong - not just ten seconds - they get links to consequences - also bad for judges to hold teams accountable - trivialization

2 - k is a prior question - debate trains students to be violent
no ethical subject formation - even if our model is violent there's no reason we adopt that mindset outside of debate

3 - performance da - judge is an educator which means ylyl
wrong - the judge is an adjudicator of arguments - the judge also should not be responsible for judging the behavior of a high schooler
