Framework arguments - always say debates should not **center** around the plan - can exclude the plans consequences, can also exclude other parts of the 1AC

Fiat is bad - we should not imagine policy oriented solution in academic spaces as they are violent
Best understood as a critique of the process of debate - roleplaying as policymakers is bad - creates a false attachment to the idea that we can solve something 
Interacts well with plan focus argument

To win the fiat K the negative needs to win the ethicality of their research matters more than the consequences of the plan

Aff needs to win one of two things:
1 - a framework argument that excludes the negs link to fiat
2 - their political project/reps are good

CX relevant - a lot of the times what the framework interp says is not important - you need to get them to say something more reasonable than whatever their interp says
for example - if they say the aff is an object of research and the 1ar doesn't say anything, the 2nr can explain it however they want

If you can get them to say all the research is relevant, even if the consequences aren't, you can argue the plan and consequences constitute the 1acs research

Examples of framework interps:

The 1AC is a foreign policy brief - doesn't say consequences are irrelevant - could not be combined with the fiat K as it does not include weighing the consequences of the 1AC

Evaluate whether the 1ACs speech act was ethical prior to the consequences of the plan - exclusive, even if the plan solves climate change if the speech act was unethical they should still lose

Role of the ballot is to x - plan exclusive but also self-serving and arbitrary

The 1AC is an object of research - can be explained both ways - the neg wants to characterize it as the research done > consequences, the aff wants to say object of research is too vague - the neg didn't say what about their research they should care about which means nothing excludes the consequences explicitly - something the 1AR should always say

YLYL - attachment to things that don't exist
The negative has said the only thing that matters is the 1AC is ethical - however that doesn't mean the only 2AR is plan focus
