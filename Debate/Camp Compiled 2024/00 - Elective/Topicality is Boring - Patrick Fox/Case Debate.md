What makes planless affs different from policy affs?
Trick question - they're structurally identical

Huge strategic benefit in investing answering the case - they get to be lazy since negatives don't often debate the case
Negs should force aff teams to innovate 

2NR has same advantages as in a policy debate - 1NC opacity, abuse them with the time advantage

Presumption - affs have huge impacts ex. cap affs saying things like warming causes extinction but reorienting our research likely doesn't solve
Their impact ev - warming causes extinction
Their solvency ev - a bunch of professors sitting around dweebing out 

Good because it's defense and you can't double turn yourself with defense - synergizes well with other arguments but you can't win on presumption alone

Solvency offense:
1 - crackdown da - self explanatory, just says they're gonna kill you

2 - small kritiks of affect - form determines content academy k type arguments, for example theorizing about feminism trades off with material action 

3 - impact turn essentialism - overlooks the way violence actually happens 

K affs usually have linear impacts - usually they don't have link chains but rather say a problem is happening now
Makes uniqueness an important part of this debate 
Affs that link less hard to offense link harder to presumption and vice cersa

affect - the idea that the way human communities are formed are not rational but rather emotive/preconscious - for affs that say "we should be empathetic" - berlant says focus on feelings allows you to be susceptible to feel good politics

answer the impact!
the only impacts that matter are the ones that solve - for example vs a policy aff if prolif o/w human rights it doesn't matter if the aff can't solve prolif

aff will use uniqueness tricks to answer your stuff - for example even if humanism is good - right now the human is the Western man and voting negative is not able to resolve it

specificity - even if the aff causes Gaza war - who cares - solves China war, which has nukes
