Rehighlight, quote aff ev
CX - set up questions with internal links

1 - Cap (Marxism)
most common position for a reason - every radical movement has had some relationship to marxism
teams not used to answering anything beyond "state good", "identity politics good" - means cap has a very high skill ceiling
grants you stuff like warming impact + turns case arguments

2- Other K's
permutation - biggest aff wincon, all strategies have to be built around answering them
alt solve/root cause argument goes a long way - the smaller the aff is lower risk the aff (net benefit to the perm) o/ws the risk of a link
judges will be confused - explain everything and use technical language like t/c, o/ws, etc

3- PIK's
critical affs agree that things like language and representation matter - if you concede these matter you can sever out of parts of the aff
specificy rewarded exponentially

4 - Procedurals
a] non t-usfg arguments - for example t - sanctions - zeroes their offense about using the state because your interp does not mandate they use the state, just that they say sanctions are bad
