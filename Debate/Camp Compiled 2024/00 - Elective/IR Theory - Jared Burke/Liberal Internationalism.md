**3 Tenants:**

1 - Economic interdependence - defined by globalization
Globalization - absolute gains the most important things
Hard power moves through economic excellence rather than just military power - the stronger your economy is the more likely you are to have a stronger military - the USSR fell as their economic prowess could not keep up with their military might

Territorial state vs Trading State
Territorial states - states that want land
Trading states - engage in globalization - transform the way in which we understand relative power - ie. the US

2 - Democratic values
Of 17 regime change wars - 3 have been successful - although democracy promotion/regime change wars may be true in the interim they prop up fascism in the long term
Democracy around the globe backsliding - more nations with voter restrictions and fascist leaders 

3 - International institutions
Idea of binding together states and tying down others - for example new start bound US and Russia together - both states give something which "binds" them

4 - Sources of international powers
Hard power - weapons, military might
Soft power - strength of international institutions through cooperative means - things like democracy, resources, etc. defined through negotiations between two countries

Power should be thought of as distributed on a 3d chess board - military power, economic power
Realism - never project weakness - the image the US projects is not what they are but rather what they want to be
Trump policy - peace through strength - basically just means deterrence

Spiral model - conflict a product of securitization - in terms of economic interdependence if both states agree upon shared ideals/are trading partners they will not go to war - disproven by things like the opium war
Will initially stop war but as states go back and forth will spiral out of control
China has placed tariffs on Chinese goods - one could argue that is now beginning to spiral out of control
Unilateral concessions may result in trust with the other side - solves the spiral model

For a deterrence model - containment/balancing vs China
One example is preventive war - first strike Iran CP backed by this theory
Seeks to integrate rising powers into the fold of the system

**China**
Post opium wars - China's regional power was gone until Mao in 1949 began to stand up to the West - Xi has tendencies that are similar to Mao because of his dad
China's revisionism comes from the century of humiliation - his dad was with Mao and Xi led anti-corruption campaigns that threw out people who were just taking money - he wants to have all the countries in the Asia Pacific bow down to China
China's final ambition - seeks to modernize the Chinese military to be large and powerful - advance Chinese presence to undermine security guarantee (also defines the way Xi thinks about military power)
Saw the US' military during gulf war and wanted to imitate it

Thus to describe Chinese revisionism - two major things that implicate it
1 - two centennial goals - first is by 2021 to build a moderately prosperous society in all respects by 2021, second is to "build a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced and harmonious" by 2049
2 - hide and abide vs fight and win


Realism is only useful to determine projection - ignores other factors - use their theory of realism to prove the aff wrong, have 2NR cards as well
