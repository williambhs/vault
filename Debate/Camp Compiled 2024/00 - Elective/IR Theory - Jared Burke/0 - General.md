Grand strategy - how a state seeks to maintain its economic + military power

Post cold war - biggest threats to American foreign policy = China/Russia

Rise of China has led to a re-concentration of power in the SCS
greatest challenge to global peace the US faces = the Chinese

Resurgent power of Russia - only <2% of the global economy but still a great power
Ideologically + politically returned to a place of prominence
The only other time this happened was the end of the cold war
Failure to end China rise/Russia resurgence -> miscalc
