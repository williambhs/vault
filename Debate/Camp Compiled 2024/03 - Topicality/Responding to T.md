1 - text - ptiv

2 - function - mandate of the plan is consistent with the interp

counterinterp - redefine every word they define or else you auto lose

solves your offense, should be limited, predictable + generate defense to neg standards
your offense:

1 - overlimiting/aff flex - their interp excludes too many affs, makes topic too small, impossible for affs to innovate
also gives neg unfair ground - pics out of any country

2 - predictability - neg interp unpredictable, relies on a weird contrived definition to exclude the aff -> goalpost shifting, neg will always go for T - should be gone for with reasonability

3 - functional limits, generics check

caselists super important - the more detailed your caselists are and what debates occur under that model the better

good rule of thumb - include an egregious aff, an aff teams are reading and people think are annoying and a third that can be either of the two

In the 2ar - if going for predictability you should also go for reasonability - the impact is substance crowd out



2AR feedback

should say impact to pics - i/l to fairness - makes the aff winrate go so far down 
extend the counterinterp
say that theory debates are bad
need a more robust explanation of why pics are unbeatable

reword barrier to entry - say easy to get a small DA 
impact to 1ar restart is that we never get to talk about the aff
