At the top - do impact calc, extend a standard (usually limits) and impact it out 

Smaller topic internally link turns predictability - explain your offense in the context of their terminal impact
Internal link comparison - worse for aff/neg to spec (is it better to have pics or aff spec)

If the aff just reads a card that uses the word "nearly all" - no intent to define which means they functionally are missing a counterinterp

If the aff only mandates the removal of oil but results in the removal of all economic sanctions - not topical

PTIV - if the words they're defining are in the plantext it's topical - PTIV says T should be a question of solvency

AT: PTIV
If you get your violation from a solvency advocate/cx, you need a counterinterp because they do meet - you should say
Counterinterp: we can get T violations from cx or we can get T violations from solvency advocates
the more things you list - the more arbitrary it becomes
the only reason it makes sense is because it's non-arbitrary
we know the aff is topical based off what the plan does, not what the plan says - makes being neg impossible because it functionally becomes drop the argument on T - incentivizes affs to write blatantly untopical advantages to force the 2NR to be split between substance and T

Effects T - an aff that results in the thing your interp says but not that 

Response to the c/i - your standardsÂ 
Sometimes - they don't meet their counterinterp
Internally link turn their best piece of offense - for example if it's limits vs pics you've already internally link turned it

speech should be set up like
1 - limits o/ws
2 - c/i can't solve your offense + offensive caselist
3 - i/l turn their strongest piece of offense
4 - defensive caselist good for answering overlimiting
5 - at: reasonability

To answer reasonability - have defense to substance crowdout - people go for it as substance crowdout DA so you might aswell just answer that
Good answer is t is substance - their args might be true in the context of dinosaur spec but debating about what economic sanctions are is obviously relevant to the economic sanctions topic

responding to pics - "barrier to entry" - writing an aff way harder than writing a pic - you need to write affs set up to answer every neg argument

for impact calc - 
limits o/ws - no reason these affs are necessary for their offense - they have reasons affs are good but not key whereas you have offense as to why those affs certainly doom the neg
for example - aff has reasons space are good but no reason space is key, but you have reasons the inclusion of space to the topic destroys negative fairness


Predictability vs limits

predictability > limits - predictable readings of the topic controls the i/l to limits - less prep is needed

limits > predictability - predictability is unquantifiable/arbitrary - you can easily compare between limits but no card will be perfectly predictable
response would be 
1 - no impact to quantifiability
2 - predictability is a threshold - if negs impact is unpredictable no one would come to debate (requires you winning a strong i/l to an arbitrariness impact)


the reason more people go for limits - ground is basically "deterrence da good, we don't get good deterrence da under their interp" but you can probably get the link vs any aff

if you have multiple definitions and go for both in the 2nr - do judge instruction - winning either one is sufficient to vote negative as they both exclude the aff 

when answering the 1AR - go through every card by name, characterize what the words highlighted in the cards say

exploit conflicting definitions - proves there isn't a unifying definition under the affs model but there is under yours
