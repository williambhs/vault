Precision - aff argument that says the negs interp is unpredictable - limits for limits sake is unpersuasive 
Intent to define - does the card define the word and use it contextually 
Is it clear that the card is an exhaustive definition
Defining it in the abstract vs the context of the res

Reasonability in the context of T - weigh the differential in the models vs substance crowd out

T 2NR Feedback:
resorts to ground later - prep that we did preround should apply
concessionary ground - could go lower where they say aff ground
extend 1nc sanctions interp - independent reason to vote neg
stronger defense of comprehensive sanctions key - it's what neg prep is structured around
don't just say college cx topics - your interp could be more than just three affs like qpq
