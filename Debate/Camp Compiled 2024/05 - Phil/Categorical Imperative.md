CI - also referred to as the moral law - provides a test for actions
A couple formulations:

1 - actions must be universalizable 
if we can imagine a world where everyone acts on the same principle it means you haven't made an exception for yourself
an example of a non universalizable maxim is lying - they lied and promised after taking a loan they would return money -  the maxim extracted would be it is permissible for an individual to accept money under a promise that they won't give it back
if we were to imagine a world where everyone made false promises the conception of promising would never exist 
interesting implication because in the nazi example it would mean lying is permissible if you're saying someones life because the maxim extracted would be that you can lie to save someones life - in a world where people only lied to save lives there would still be a conception of truth telling

2 - act in a way that we respect rational agency - can't use people as a mere means
kant demonstrated we're unconditional sources of value - acting in accordance with the categorical imperative the only way to ensure we don't disrespect the humanity of others - rational agency is the hallmark of our agency and means we can't treat people as a mere means
in other words - the principle of my action can't use you solely to achieve my ends
