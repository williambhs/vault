Why strategic?
1 - some people are npcs, don't know how to respond 
2 - easy to cut - sep, etc all written by qualified authors - can cutt an entire aff with 1-2 articles
3 - solvency deficit to every pic - winning framework shows the principle of said action is consistent with the categorical imperative

AT intentions unverifiable -
the word intent does not refer to the mental state of the person taking the action but rather the principle/maxim extracted from that conclusion - this means verifiability is less important

Kant thinks the creation of a state is necessary - anarchy sucks because we need a state to enforce right claims to make sure we can't violate each others freedoms

win some impact defense to the DA - hard to win 100% risk of extinction
as the soft left/kant debater point out even if you drop a DA or something it's not an 100% risk of extinction but rather they just get access to the full weight of the conceded card

you should always contest the framework and the offense
