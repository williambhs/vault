**General**

Most people are good people - however the existence of amoralists and psychopaths show that maybe morality is a result of our upbringing/evolution
Kant's motivation is to show that moral requirements are universally binding by virtue of what we are as human beings

In other words, he believes human rationality presupposes a commitment to moral law.
If this is true -

1 - morality is binding to everyone, and you can't just "opt out" of morality - also means it's inescapable and as a human you are committed to acting moral
That's not to say everything we do is moral or we must always act morally, but rather we SHOULD act morally

2 - would imply amoralists are not rational 
typically when someone does something immoral - characterized as "rude" instead of "irrational"
for kant - immorality constitutes irrationality

apriori - not derived from the empirical world but rather prior to that
connect moral requirements directly to the nature of rationality
examples of things that are apriori - math, logic, etc
a triangle has three sides because conceptually triangles have three sides - if you said you knew a triangle has three sides because every time you've seen a triangle it has three sides that would be a different form of reasoning

**What does Kant think about human nature?**

three parts of human nature:

1 - animality - we have desires such as survival instinct, hunger, thirst, etc.
we don't have control over these desires - we can't just choose to not be tired because we are fundamentally biological organisms
pigs will eat pig carcasses - they won't reflect and be like "I'm eating my brother" but instead will eat because it feels hungry - this is why we differ from other animals as we have humanity which is why we don't just go around trying to eat anything

2 - humanity - although we have raw impulses, what makes us distinct is our ability to practically reason - practical reason = things I ought to do - for example at lunch if there's a pizza before taking a second slice you might practically reason and reflect on whether you should take a second slice since you might want to leave some whereas an animal would just eat the entire thing
practical freedom - the ability to act in whatever way we have reasoned - that's not to say we don't always do this however, which constitutes irrationality - for example if I know I should get out of bed but want to sleep in, if I were to sleep in that would be an example of acting irrationally - that means although we can practically reason that doesn't mean we're perfect practical reasoners and can act instinctually 

the way our reasoning works - all our actions are prompted by desires which we have no control over
what makes human special/the value theory stuff - is personality

3 - personality - we are able to set and pursue ends that are independent - kant thinks this happens when we act out of duty - the only time we do this is when we act out of duty/recognize it's the right thing to do
for example - if you're at home watching your favorite show and your mom asks for help moving groceries - you might help her even though you don't want to which means acting out of duty > base desires

the good will - if you are trying to do the good thing out of recognition that it's the right thing to do
good will - both intrinsically and unconditionally good - that means 
1 - intrinsically good - it's good in and of itself and not because of something else
2 - unconditionally good - always good - doesn't apply to something like pleasure - there are sadistic pleasures 

kant debater - good will o/ws pleasure because it's unconditionally good
util debater - everything is motivated by pleasure - means even if somewhat has sadistic pleasures that's good for them as an individual - hedonist doesn't just say pleasure is good but also that pain creates disvalue which means sadistic pleasures are usually bad because they disproportionately cause pain

logical conclusion of us being able to take fully autonomous actions independent of inclination - we possess a good will which explains why we are unconditional sources of value
kant thinks the good will is required for your action to have moral worth - the fact that we are "originators" of value makes us unconditional sources of value
