Identify what the aff has the weakest defense of - if no reason why congress is key, why sanctions are key, etc. you can pic out of one of those

Affs generally written relatively poorly - usually easier than going for the squo

use cx - set internal link thresholds, ask for the internal link to x impact - for example if they say it's mistrust then if your cp solves trust it solves their impact
a lot of the time you should go for cp paired with some case defense

sufficiency framing - no impact to the deficit beyond what the cp solves
when responding to perms - make args about textual + functional intrinsicness/severance

answering the intrinsic perm:
1 - "permutation gaming" - you can create new sentences
2 - neg ground - textual competition is bad - the model that legitimizes these permutations is like scrabble 

Don't forget to judge kick the cp if it's implicated by the 1AR
