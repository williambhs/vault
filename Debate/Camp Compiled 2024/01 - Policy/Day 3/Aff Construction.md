When the topic comes out - cut T cards first

Solvency advocate - explains what the plan does, it's process, what the world looks like if the plan were to be implemented 
Better than any alternative when generating deficits - you have evidence to describe the plan
For the NoKo aff - Bandow says sectoral sanctions could still exist as it relates to Kim's nuclear development
If neg pic'd out of sanctions - be prepared to say pdcp 

Be able to defend other sanctions Bandow says the aff eliminates 
Solvency advocate important because adv cp becomes very threatening - you don't have an ev argument that says why the plan solves

Also harder to beat pics for competition reasons - if the aff doesn't have a solvency advocate, any CP likely doesn't need an advocate either - just need to find the issues with the status quo and find some solution
Often in 1AC cards - impact cards often have recommendations on how to solve impacts

Plantext - should not be long and confusing - the more planks you specify the more things the neg can pic out of 

Do neg research - have a good idea of what people are going to say against your aff
ex. for NoKo aff - sanctions fail a key argument - but you need to be prepared to answer adv cps

know strategies against different 1ncs - which da's to straight turn, which da's don't link, etc

New affs - write new affs for a reason - w/ particular teams in mind, break them strategically
Know what the other team wants to go for - for example if a team always goes for process cps vs new affs have good certainty/immediacy key justifications

Diversify internal links and impacts - that way it's harder to solve multiple internal links, or if you have one impact they can just read a bunch of impact defense to your one impact
Also don't have one internal link and like 30 impacts - otherwise one adv cp that answers your internal link solves all the impacts

The less internal links you need to access your impact the better

If they break new - ask if there are any old cards in case they just took out one card or slightly changed the plantext
