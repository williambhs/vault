CX is not a speech - not about what you say but rather what your opponent says
For example - "why does Korea want to nuclearize"
Aff debater will list out warrants - but this is good for the negative going for deterrence as they will be things lifting sanctions cannot solve

Who? What? Where?
Who uses a nuke? What do they do? Where do they escalate?
Two subsequent implications:
1 - prep out your questions, dramatically increases your ethos and speaks
2 - write down the answers to your questions when it's relevant (ex. prolif desire inevitable -1AC cx said quote "sanctions are key to Koreas regime")

Do not ask for a line in evidence
Do not meta-narrate your strategy
