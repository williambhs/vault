Link turn without impact defense

UQ - important for the impact and i/l
Disads should provide link uq - sometimes they also provide uniqueness for the i/l and the impact

UQ is probabilistic - not a binary 
Link controls the direction of uniqueness

Thumpers can contest link uq and the strength of the link
Can also contest the strength of the link - for example if a similar policy to the aff will pass that also would trigger the da - but that policy can't solve the adv or it's no longer inherent

Possible to UQ cp your way out of thumpers - if aff says bad policy passing now that's a worse version of the plan, thumps DA neg can CP to solve it
