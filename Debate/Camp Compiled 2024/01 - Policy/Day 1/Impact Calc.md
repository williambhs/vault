Start 2NRs with "X impact o/ws and turns the case" instead of an o/v
Impacts should be comparative
Not why your impact is big - why your impact is bigger than theirs
Don't drop 2NR impact calc
In the context of turns case - better turns case arguments are lower in the i/l chain
Instead of nuke war turns warming - explain why the link implicates aff solvency

Timeframe pairs well with this - link is fast because it's perception based
If the perception link is big - likely faster than aff solvency

Probability doesn't make much sense unless they have no defense to the case 
Timeframe answers try or die - your impact is existential b ut it's faster

Can also use magnitude - basically should be your impact encompasses theirs, similar to turns case - for example prolif impact vs China impact - our impact means Korea AND China proliferate

Try or die - extinction is inevitable
Can't just say alt causes if it causes extinction - has to say it doesn't cause extinction/read defense

Impact calc doesn't always have to be about terminal impacts - should be on the level the debate is happening
