Easy to win process cps are bad - the problem is the interpretation
Negs objection to theory will almost always be that it excludes other types of interpretations that are desirable

Good interp text: cps that cause the plan are a voting issue

negative will say cp doesn't cause the plan - that's not what cause means (cause is not certain)
for example - gunshots kill people, doesn't mean everyone who gets shot dies
process cps not k2 beat small affs - lazy debating
neg has no reason why they need this cp - the interp only invalidates this cp

talk about how your interp is not arbitrary, doesn't exclude cps

Condo: 3 args why it's good

1 - neg flex 
not a very good arg in ld

2 - innovation
education impact for why condo is good - encourages negatives to experiment, if they only get one cp they'll just read process - causes research to stagnate, also good for aff research since they have to look for answers to cp

3 - arbitrariness/logic/reasonability
teams that go for theory don't want to debate substance - doesn't make debate impossible - just get good lol

if you go for condo - 

1 - condo bad - discourages reading offense against cps which is usually the true reason cps are undesirable
under dispo - becomes a debate of whether plan vs cp is good which means negs would have a robust defense of the cp

2 - quality of 1ncs deteriorating - anti-educational - 30 plank adv cps

lbl
neg flex impact turned - who cares if the neg wins more if those debates are bad
research linked turned
more cps not k2 research
depth > breadth
dispo non-arbitrary - 2024 so people know what it is
logic is not an impact
