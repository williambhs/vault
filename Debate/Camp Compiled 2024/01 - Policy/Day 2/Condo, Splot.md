Ask for CP NB in CX

**Condo:**
Aff should say no judge kick at the bottom of the condo sheet
Dispo - solves neg flex
l/ts strategic thinking?*

Unconditional doesn't mean it has to be the 2NR - ie. if the alt is uncondo 2NR can be T
Also means the CP can be unconditional but if there aren't DA's to the alt/CP you don't have to extend it

CP competition - aff wants to say it's a neg burden - you need to win a model of competition to win aff without a deficit - some judges think you need a deficit to win with an intrinsic perm, others don't

Judge kick - uniquely bad because it kills strategic thinking
Conditions under which to judge kick - permutation, links to nb, offense

SPLOT - 

Solvency Deficit - 
always have one, even if fake
2AR should answer sufficiency framing - solvency is a sliding scale - not a sufficient amount of solvency as to where the CP solves enough 
CP solves better than the aff - not a reason to vote neg 

Permutations - 
PDCP - relevant when judge kicking a pic as an advocacy - da still intrinsic to the plan
If 2AR kicks the CP - can't extend the perm to say it shields the link to the DA

Perm shields the link to the da
no tradeoff between plan and cp which means 2nr needs a deficit to do both
only works when the cp provides uq for the internal nb

PDB - double solvency
this is stupid, no impact to solving 2x

Lie perm responds to process cp as well


Links to the NB -
Setup in cx - you can say it doesn't do x - then concede their response to links to the nb as a solvency deficit
If the 1ar has a no link argument - implicates whether the cp links as well

Offense - 
DAs to the cp

Add-on > DA if the CP is condo - strategic when short and not easily straight turned
Don't need to be on the case page - can be tricky and on the case page
Different judges have different opinions on whether or not it's allowed - negs should say it's too late breaking, can't cp out of it or read too many cards

Theory -
Good shells:
1 - international fiat - infinite actors, impossible to find a solvency deficit
2 - object fiat/mindset shift ie. the US should "stop" doing x
