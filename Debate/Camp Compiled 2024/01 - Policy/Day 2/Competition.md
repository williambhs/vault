Every cp could result in the plan (unless ban the plan)
Competition based off the effects of the plan = bad
Competition should be based off the mandate of the plan, not effects

Answers pdcp - the affs competition arguments in the context of process cps assume counterplans compete off the effects, not the mandates 

Intrinsic perms - include the permtext in the doc

Aff - counterplans must be textually and functionally competitive

hard to defend - textual competition does not make a lot of sense
textual competition means word pics are now competitive - replace ought with should
also bad for the neg - no reason scramble perms/adding words wouldn't be considered legitimate


Going for the intrinsic perm in the 2ar -
1 - eliminates process cps where the nb is not about the plan 
2 - functional/textual competition is good - textual competition is objective, functions are undefined - up for debate in every debate, function alone makes it impossible
3 - function only is more arbitrary

unstrategic as you have to win that process cps are bad - might as well just win process cps bad

intrinsic perm vs consult cps w/ internal nbs - intrinsic perm proves the nb is not germane 
for ex:

plan - us should remove sanctions from noko
cp - us should consult soko over removal of sanctions then remove sanctions from noko 

bad: perm aff + consult soko over venezuela then remove sanctions from noko
bad because it's completely intrinsic

better: perm aff + consult soko over sanctions then remove sanctions from noko
better because it's textually non-intrinsic

however - the justification for the intrinsic perm usually presupposes that you win that consult cps are a bad model of debate - same arguments about theory apply
