Models of competition

1 - functional competition 
function of the cp is different from what the plan does

2 - textual competition
words in plantext vs words in the cp text

debate usually boils down to functional competition vs functional + textual competition

positional competition - based off positions the aff has taken - ie cx, solvency advocate, etc. - if in cx the aff says the executive does the plan then the courts cp/congress cp automatically compete 
justifications:
1 - checks vague plans
2 - aff should have to describe the plan
3 - good for aff strategy + cards

textual competition - ptiv

functional competition - competes off the function of the plan

mandate of the plan = what the plan fiats/directly does

3 ways in which cps complete - agent, mechanism, fiat

PIC - competes off the function of the plan
adv cp - competes off the mechanism of the plan
courts/exec cp - competes off the agent

process cps that compete off of fiat - should usually go for the perm 
neg establishes competition by saying a model of fiat under which the aff is forced to be certain/immediate is good - good for das - forces aff to have timely advs
generally these cps should lose to competition/theory


uq cp - cp that provides uq for a da - needs to answer the perm
1 - mutual exclusivity - cp literally cannot be combined with the plan ie. cp increases sanctions while plan decreases sanctions
2 - voids the nb
