**Overview/UQ**

Sanctions globally are the biggest symbol of US commitment to human rights globally - Biden has publicly taken a stance in the UN using sanctions as a mechanism for retributive justice - the plan would be seen as a 180 and us ignoring human rights abuses, tanking our global credibility

**Link Debate**

1 - Perception - mostly explained above. Good link argument writ large but not as its own link argument.
2 - Iran - lifting sanctions results in an emboldenment of Iranian hardliners and would cause them to continue HR violations, signaling to the rest of the world that the US is unbothered by Iran's HR abuses.
3 - NoKo - NoKo an authoritarian regime - basically same as above as to why lifting sanctions affects that

**Impact**

1 - Conflict Mediation - HR cred allows for de-escalation by stressing the importance of accountability - ignoring abuses makes future conflict more likely as parties can spin grievances into invocations for conflict
2 - Liberal Democracy - Western institutions and democracy are based on upholding rule of law - basically a primacy impact

Aff answers - 
1 - Non UQ - Biden not successful in handling Gaza, abortion rights overturned, etc.
2 - Sanctions result in worse HR abuses - create humanitarian crises as they damage economics, trigger backlash + corruption + repression, etc.
3 - Impact defense - cred doesn't do anything
