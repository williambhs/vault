Think of it as a "counter-idea" - uq for the links - don't describe it as solving the impact or else it loses to perm double bind

PIK out of the affs assumptions - makes sense because the links are never about the plan - means the alt can exist in the world of the aff
Means the aff has to impact turn it

The alternative imagines something occurs - however doesn't necessarily mean it's fiated.
When you say it's "fiated" - it refers to the bracketing out of questions of likelihood - reciprocal because the aff doesn't have to either

AT: Perm double bind
Explain the alt so that it solves the link, not the impact
