Fiat - not just about hypothetical policy actions
The bracketing out of questions of likelihood.

Why is it good?

Fairness/education concerns - stale debates if it's about whether or not the plan will happen - objective question where it's a binary
Fiat is the backbone of research - allows us to be better advocates 
In-depth topic research gives us better skills - portable skills that inform us about things in the real world
