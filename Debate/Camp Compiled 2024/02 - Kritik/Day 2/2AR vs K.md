In the 2AR - 
1 - win framework - why your impacts outweigh under your fw interp
2 - extinction outweighs
3 - alt can't solve the case - impact turned the alt
4 - answer the link - specifically why it implicates the case

order: 
framework, extension, link, alt

link/turn - explain why the alternative can't solve (not fast enough, etc)
answer links w/ offense - say the perm solves the impact to the k but the alt can't solve the impact to the link turn \

if extending the perm - have to answer fw still - if impact turning fw can implicate the ability for the alt to solve the case

answers to the links have to be why the case outweighs them - reason the alt can't solve the case should be about humanitarian crisis

also answer the k overview
use their language 

in the 2AR vs TDI camp K - Russia/China monopolizing now - only a risk of integration - that means the impact to the link is non-uq which means the alt can't solve the reason it's happening now
also means it's a question of opportunity cost - US monopolization not as bad

don't just pretend there is no link - make args as to why the case o/ws
offense/defense - if you don't have time to implicate your offense just extend some short defense - flag impact at the top, explain why it outweighs

example of a 2ar vs the TDI K - 

1 - impact turn strategy:

impact turns require impact defense - means you should go for an external impact at the top of the 2ar and explain why the alternative cannot solve it - that way you just need defense on the links instead of why they're good

tldr - here is something the alt can't solve that the case solves 
then - for all the links you're not going for, answer the links

2 - l/t + perm strategy:
\
prolif o/ws even if they win some link, alt cannot solve - the aff is k2 the alt since economic sanctions are imperialist

sanctions are a barrier - how are countries in the global south going to do transnational movements if they functionally don't exist

alt fails movement has to be connected to something the plan solves

at: link
explain why the prolif link is wrong - lifting sanctions is good for anti-imperialism

defense to the other links - why the aff isn't imperialist, no impact to securitization + LIO not inherently colonialist

at: alt

doesn't solve prolif


if the 2nr is framework heavy 2ar should be framework + extinction o/ws
