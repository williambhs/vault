Links - point to the assumptions of the 1AC
To win a link - must be in pieces of ev of the 1AC, CX explanations
You need to win the aff relies on faulty assumptions, not just that those assumptions are bad

Securitization - constructing China/Russia as a threat justifies further military expansion, American aggression

Just because the aff has a China impact doesn't mean you automatically have a link - you need to explain why specifically they securitize China

Example on open borders:
good because militarized border control is violent
vs
we should open the us canada border because it solves the lio

First example avoids many link arguments - the strength of your link depends on how the aff is explained

Why is K debate good - makes us more informed about political scholarship, academic scholarship, reps shape reality
reps shape reality - if the reasons for a policy action are flawed then the implementation of that policy will be flawed

Links - describe what is problematic about the 1AC
each link should have a different impact

Sino-Russian alliance link - framing US as a threat is bad - shouldn't describe things as binaries ie. US good Russia bad
impacts to your link arguments should be diversified

As the aff debater - alt provides uniqueness for the links which means to go for l/t you must also go for the permutation
