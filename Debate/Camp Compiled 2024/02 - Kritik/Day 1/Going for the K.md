4 things:

1 - explanation of your link ev - substantiate what part of the aff you disagree with

2 - contextualization - connection between what the link criticizes and what the 1ac has said

3 - external impact to the link - each link should have its own impact, otherwise loses to "impacts non unique, the plan doesn't cause any impacts"

4 - turns the case, implicates solvency

Retag your cards every round to be contextual to the aff you are debating, pull lines from the aff in the 2nr

Example link extension/drill:

The affs lifting of sanctions should not be viewed as a normalization of relations but rather an attempt to reintegrate North Korea into the world economy.

This liberal international order is not exclusionary but rather inclusionary, seeking to assimilate the global south and culminating in colonial resource extraction.

This drive towards a global economy is terminally unsustainable and prioritizes profit over people, reducing them to labor.
Turns the aff - neoliberalism causes militarized reinterventions as foreign powers seek to modernize the global south
That also implicates solvency - Kim hates the idea of US hegemony and will never turn to the negotiation table 

Feedback: explain the 1NC ev shorter, explain why the aff links more

In CX:

Try to get them to explain their internal links as academically indefensible

"What parts of the squo do you take a problem with?"

If reading lines from a card, has to be short, concise, clear - 5-10 lines

Answering the case:

1 - impact defense
(lio link means lio doesn't do anything, i/l turns the adv)

2 - k o/ws
utilitarian calculus is bad - da to their reps that should come first
generally unpersuasive if you don't have case defense
util necessitates violences - magnitude a bad metric because unlikely

3 - alt solves case - case inevitable because of capitalism

4 - framework - two interps:
a] middle ground - weigh the case - view the 1ac as a policy prescription - justifications for the advs are things they have to defend
not voting for the ptiv - also real world 
b] ylyl - accountability - debaters should be accountable for the research they present in round, encourages 1ac to be epistemically sound - weigh the case means even if they are racist they can still win

at perm
1 - severance - perm is not the plan + alt but rather 1ac + the alt 
2 - use offense/defense - if the alt solves the case no reason to include the aff - causes cooption 
3 - links are disads - explain why combining the two are impossible 
4 - perm double bind incoherent - fw means it's a question of epistemic compatibility

at perm double bind
the alt rejects the false choice between a us led international order and chinese/russian spoi - the alt says we should not think about the lio as exclusive with either the economic or military development of countries in the global south
"a will to dominate is countered by the will to resist" - disagrees with the idea that there are a select few states that are self interested
rejecting the imposition of norms on the global south on the us would entail transnational movements - its ethic is distinct from the 1ac - imagines a democratic world where states are politically and economically equal
the alt says we should not focus on economic development and integration because it makes resisting the western led order impossible - that means if you win a link any investments into neoliberal paradigms are in fundamental opposition to the alt
say the 1ac/aff team should endorse an anti imperial internationalism instead of the lio/economic integration - alt competes with the advantages and not the plan
solves the case, all the countries would be equal - solves noko war because they would be building a world for each other

basically - to beat the perm double bind you need to win that the alt doesn't fiat movements, but rather fiats an idea - the mandate of the alt would then result in movements

fpiks good
1 - justifications inform ir
2 - plans vague - should be framed by the 1acs advantage prescriptions - if lifting sanctions could happen gradually the US could drag its feet - imposes a strategic cost on the aff not specifying details of implementation
