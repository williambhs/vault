Fiat is illusory - not a presumption argument - rather an offensive argument as to why they need a defense of fiat, under framework you can win a kritik of their model of scenario planning

K does not "uplayer" the aff - it's not a procedural but equally true of the aff a lot of the time
ROTB says your ballot is a procedural question which means your impact comes first - this is stupid

As aff - clarify what the aff fiats - if the fiat solves the impact to the link arguments there's no reason why the inclusion of the aff is bad 

Common theory argument - the alt has to be a policy action - this is incoherent since it wouldn't be able to solve the links - but the negative can explain how the alt's mandate would result in x policy action
