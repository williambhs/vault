Only committed to the 1AC - means you don't have to defend everything
Don't let the neg make link arguments in a vacuum - for example the debate should be about the aff and it's relation to capitalism instead of capitalism in a vacuum - if the debate becomes about the K's theory of power you will probably lose if you are aff

Decide whether to link turn or impact turn the K - because you want to make it about the aff you don't need to defend every example of securitization in history, just that the aff isn't securitizing, or the affs form of securitization is good

Specificity is good - if you read a bunch of random cap good cards the 2NR will just outcard you

Impact defense often underutilized - no impact to securitization, no impact to endless war

Answer the theory of power
Answer the alt - can't solve the links, can't solve the case

Judge choice - the aff gets to choose which reps are relevant - if you have two advantages and they only read links to one judge choice = they can kick out of their reps because the judge can say the plan is good because of adv 1 the negative has not read links to

CX - 
ask which parts of the aff the k disagrees with
they will probably say "all of it"
ask why it disagrees with the specific internal links - ie. why does the k disagree with iran prolif
then ask if the alt disagrees with it - if it does that's good because it means the alt can't solve the case

what does the mandate of the alt result in
impact to the link, impact to winning ontology
