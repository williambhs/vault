Use the advantage to prove their intent is capitalist - but no extinction impact from capitalism. Capitalism is ethically a violent action and bad under the categorical imperative 

Capitalism is the ultimate violation of the categorical imperative:

1 - exploitation of labor - treats workers as a means to an end for profit rather than ends for themselves - that can't be universalized because everyone would be exploited - contradictory 

2 - relies on economic inequalities - relies on some accessing the means of production while others work for it - cannot be universalized as that inequality cannot be universal - it also implies some rights are less than others which would undermine the moral law that agents have intrinsic value

3 - intrinsically driven by competition and self interest which results in actions that harm other for personal gain - conflicts with moral rules that says individuals should act out of duties - a maxim where we should harm for individual gain is impossible because it's contradicting

if we win this link - it proves they do not solve the means to an end argument as the aff weaponizes the people of iran and iran itself to further americas national security and interests
