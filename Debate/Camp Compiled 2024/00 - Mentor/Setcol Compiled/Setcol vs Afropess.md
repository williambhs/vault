Thesis of setcol - two link arguments

First - afropess says blackness operates on a unique structural antagonism
Your argument is that that is not the only antagonism
Antiblackness is a twin antagonism - exists in parallel with setcol
The trick is that there is not a burden to prove that setcol is a worse ontological violence but that they exist in parallel and that humanism + settler government oscillates between including black people into civil society and excluding indigeneity and indigeneity being included into civil society and excluding black people

They will say indigenous owned slaves - we do not contest that claim
However - Buffalo soldiers - all black soldiers - cleared indigenous bodies in the west

Thus civil societies will include strategically black folk to exclude indigenous folk and the opposite

Forces a division between black and indigenous people - creates a wedge between coalitionary politics
The binary is your link argument

Why can't we just perm? Their argument is that indigeneity is between black vs non black but your argument is that indigeneity also operates on a different level


Second link argument - turn to natal alienation
Natal alienation says black bodies -> middle passage
Groundlessness - actively violent
Root cause of antiblack violence is placelessness - not belonging - reason why so many black people are shot because they are seen as out of place in a public space
Fundamental misreading/violent as it overdetermines the level of ontology/social death to obscure black relationships and the kinship that followed
Overdetermines black peoples relationships to land

Warburton - overdetermination of social death - obscures + obfuscates black social agency

Tuck - form of geospatial dysphoria - renders them as placeless

Pess debaters will say indigenous have the capacity of loss whereas black people don't because the middle passage stopped them from having anything to lose but indigenous people still have land

Obfuscates the idea that land is indigeneity - the erasure of land is indigenous death because indigenous creation stories are founded by their relation to land, thus land is not something indigenous people own or some humanist capacity for loss but rather that loss is predetermined in the loss of their life
"Land K" - thinking of land as something that is owned instead of something that indigenous own as fungible property is violent 

1 - gratuitous violence - more likely for an indigenous women to be sexually assaulted than to graduate high school - no logical reason for that to be the case - proves the gratuitous nature of indigenous violence

2 - general dishonor - manifest destiny, disappearing Indian - examples of how we have overdetermined indigeneity - attachment to indigenous death to facilitate settler growth - "kill the indian to save the man" is a juarez quote 
indigenous people are valued less than the resources the land can provide - reduced as fungible groups because they are overdetermined via the value of the resources they have on the land

3 - natal alienation - impact turned - natal alienation IS placeness but you're saying that's good
black land project done by eve tuck - documented and archived the way black people related to the land
your offense is that natal alienation is actively bad - it is ahistorical and when people are SEEN as placeless that is bad because it causes genocidal clearing

the alternative - byrd ev says we should use and leverage place with other people - leveraging place as something that can bind people together can create shared relationalities that can resolve the impacts of placelessness - would also resolve the binary link because the world would not resolve in a dyad

settlement + conquest render blackness as fungible - colonialism is the reason people thought about slaves - not just about indigenous people but rather affects all groups - king says the process of terra nullius/clearing of the land are all examples that could affect black people at all - does not deny anti-black violence but rather changes the way we theorize about it

not a double turn with framework because your arguments don't say the state is bad but rather are a counter way to theorize 

the way the aff will answer this:
ruse of analogy - borrows the analytic of afropessimism - shouldn't be shared - but you've impact turned this with the dyad link
