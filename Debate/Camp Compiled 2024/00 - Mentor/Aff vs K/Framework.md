Framework - a way to explain how to access offense
Question becomes offense for who

If you are aff - you want to say we get access to our offense and they get access to their offense

Best middle ground - both sides get access to offense

Plan focus:

Negatives must disprove plan desirability via the status quo or a competitive policy option

potential avenues for offense - we get the aff, they don't get reps links
if you are negative you can still access your impact if you win that reps shape reality
the way we understand the world shapes the way we interact with the world

if they concede your fw interp, you automatically win basically - framework extinction o/ws because the links become nuq but the aff does something uq to solve extinction which means a risk they solve extinction massively o/ws the link

however - not the greatest fw interp - too restrictive

However - pomo K's
Answer reps shape reality with a card or good analytic - means it can't turn the case
