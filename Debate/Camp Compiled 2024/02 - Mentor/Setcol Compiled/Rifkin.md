Link turn assumes the way we engage in settler colonialism is about plans but setcol is an embodied set of ideological beliefs that are repeated 

Structure vs Event 

Structure - The prior basis on which we are situated and interact

Event - One off occurance

Setcol is a structure, not an event - the systemic influences our social interactions
You are not changing the way we understand the world via social interactions but rather demonstrating the structures you are indoctrinated within

Debate is a site of repetition compulsion - we constantly assume particular things

If you win structuralism, the plan is a one off occurrence which means it cannot change settler colonialism
However - the alternative would resolve it
Refusal is an unsettling of our assumption - makes it a combatting of the structure of settler colonialism 
Plans cannot unsettle our assumptions which means it cannot solve the links

Fiating giving back the land makes the debate weird - if you win framework the only material impact is refusal of scholarship - all the alternative has to do is unsettle our assumptions

If they ask what that looks like materially - you say the only material impact in debate is a disruption of our scholarship
