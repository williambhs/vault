AT Common objections:

1 - intents unverifiable
intent - a synonym for maxim - doesn't matter what their mindset was 

2 - tailoring objection
kant assumes people are using the categorical imperative in good faith - basically if the person using it is cheating it doesn't work

3 - degrees of wrongness
assumes util and tradeoffs which means it doesn't matter

Ideal theory link/abstraction link - imagines a world where there is no state, explains why states should exist, etc.
Ivory tower theorizing - not applicable to real life

They will say ideal theory is good - ideal-theory doesn't preclude the ability to reach solutions but rather provides a helpful tool for criticizing them - also it's good we have a rigorous justification for why humans are equal
