<h2> NoKo Aff </h2>

**Adv -- Non-Prolif**

Max pressure fails to spur negotiations - raises tensions on the Korean peninsula
1 - external hostility - tensions high now, uq from this year - regime perceives pressure as undermining sovereignty 
2 - security dilemma - Japan and SoKo will prolif in response to testing in NoKo - domino effect
3 - erodes npt - international agreement less credible as a result of NoKo development

Two impacts - cascading prolif, miscalc -> wider east asian war that draws in the US because of alliance comitments


Sanctions evasions drives Russia/China/NoKo trilateral partnership 
Russia: Ukraine = aff uq, Putin isolated from sanctions
China: increasingly tolerant, used to agree with UN sanctions but now started to veto them - shows they are content with nuclear testing
Finally, historical precedent - first decade of the cold war/Korean war - cooperated in the past in the name of "anti-imperialism"

Two Impacts: NE Asian stability - emboldens NoKo, second is LIO - heg impact that says kills US influence and emboldens human rights violators - says decline of primacy increases risk of war

**Adv -- Engagement**

Plan normalizes US-NoKo economic engagement - US overstretched now with China - if NoKo is reintegrated into the global economy they would normalize relations with SoKo, essentially reunification - would cause SoKo to also be able to balance better against China

Two Impacts: 
1 - Transition wars - Chinese regional hegemony -> military/economic competition, increases chance for miscalc around major hotspots ie. SCS/ECS/Taiwan
2 - Probing - weak alliance structure causes probing - similar to the LIO impact


**Adv -- Human Rights**
1 - NoKo militarization bad for human rights 
2 - Trust key - peace agreements create conditions for engagement on human rights
mostly relevant as l/t's to human rights cred da


**Solvency**

Plan solves NPT 
The plan does NOT remove UN sanctions - but could result as a mandate of the plan 
Your argument should be the plan lifting sanctions leads to negotiations - the plan has to remove sanctions before NoKo begins denuclearization
Two things relevant - US has to denuclearize first, and sanctions disproportionately impact the civilian population - civs responsible to bring Kim to negotiations because of how the regime is structured

<h2> NoKo Neg </h2>
**Counterplans** 

Arms Control CP - limited arms control agreement limits NoKo's nuclear modernization

Containment CP - planks say we should strengthen our allies defenses to deter Chinese regional hegemony

UQ CP that increases sanctions - increases targeted sanctions on Korea - secondary sanctions changed Kim's approach in 2019 and would solve through stopping NoKo sanctions evasions efforts
(Relevant with deterrence DA, secondary sanctions = sanctioning NoKo's allies such as China)

**Case Page**

**Turns**

Regional Stability turn - deterrence argument that says sanctions means NoKo has less money to spend on developing/producing nukes as well as putting political pressure on NoKo which limits their ability to be aggressive

Containment Turn - US influence destabilizes the region - aggressive FoPo -> economic failure + interstate war, engagement/balancing deepens interdependence
Force causes a Taiwan invasion because the US inspires resentment

Diversionary War Turn - similar to Kim Lashout DA, economic integration causes Kim to lash out and a diversionary war - he fears Western propaganda which means he will engineer a small war in an attempt to cling to power because he fears Western influence

Aff Answers:
Regional stability - deterrence failing now... the entire aff answers the turn
Diversionary War - Kim fears regime collapse now, aff link/turns and solves


**Solvency**

Restrictions require sanctions - NoKo not a good faith negotiator - only reason they would come to the negotiating table is if they have to due to sanctions
Also empirically denied - NoKo emboldened since they feel like they've successfully evaded tensions as Russia/China continue to cooperate with them despite sanctions

Many many alt causes to engagement - sanctions not the only reason NoKo hates us

**Answering Aff Impacts**

HR Crisis - not caused by sanctions but rather domestic mismanagement, when NoKo receives aid it doesn't use it to build up its economy

Tensions - no imminent war - NoKo historically over-emphasizes threats for psychological reasons

No trilateral axis - bilateral cooperation may be happening but China and Russia have different interests that don't align in the long term
