**Deterrence -- Korea**
NoKo comprehensively sanctioned - means all financial relations are severed - meant to have macroeconomic effects more than target specific sectors
The goal of crushing the Korean economy is to reduce their nuclear advances - each addition to the sanctions regime occured in the context of their nuclear program (ie. nuclear testing)

**Deterrence -- Korean Reunification**
Sanctions on NoKo are multilateral - SoKo participates in that coalition - economic isolation of NoKo makes reunification of the Korean Peninsula unlikely

DA suggests North South relations + reunification are bad - it would entail less military presence which sets a precedent that makes the invasion of Taiwan more likely
The link is normalization from the second advantage

**Deterrence -- Iran**
Iran is similarly comprehensively sanctioned - lifted as part of the 2015 Iran Deal, robust debate over whether or not lifting sanctions increased or decreased the rapidity of nuclear development

**Deterrence -- Counterterror**
US uses targeted sanctions against Iran - terror DA says if we remove counterterror sanctions Iran feels more emboldened to support non-state actors, but if normalized and we cooperated it would be unlikely for them to build connections with terrorists

Aff has two main arguments against this DA:
1 - deterrence failing now in the squo
2 - the plan solves the terminal - ie. deterrence da causes NoKo war, plan solves
Best strategy likely to straight turn the DA

To get around this - the negative has a couple of options in the form of CPs
UQ CP - solves the 1 pt as it would mean deterrence will stop failing in the squo
Second is the QPQ CPP - stands for Quid Pro Quo and stands for something to something - argues lifting sanctions unilaterally can't access the diplomatic leverage i/l because it would mean the US no longer has leverage - removal based on conditions utilizes that leverage to extract concessions from target country
Competes off the word remove - removal doesn't imply there is a quid pro quo - removal not permanent
Maintains coercive diplomacy rather than good faith diplomacy - basically the equivalent of horse-trading
