<h2> Iran Aff </h2>

**Adv - Prolif**

Sanctions result in a power concentration in elites - destroys the Iranian Middle Class and encourages prolif - Iran on the verge of going nuclear - however sanctions relief brings them back to the negotiating table
Allies want cooperation with Iran as they are fearful of destabilization - Iran funds terrorists, etc.
Iran not interested in the JCPOA now - called on the US to lift oil sanctions, they see it as good faith 
Absent the plan, Iran prolifs as hardliners gain power - sanctions make Iran feel the only way to get concession is through aggression which makes them prolif, causes cascading prolif

Independent of prolif - sanctions cause Iran to become more aggressive in the region - they feel sanctions/backlash are inevitable so there isn't a cost to aggressive expansion

Relatively simple aff.

<h2> Iran Neg </h2>
**Counterplans**

Regime Change CP - does a bunch of things to dispose of the current Iranian regime while maintaining sanctions
Best 1AR angle is timeframe deficit + sanctions key warrant - leverage i/l about cooperation that the CP solves less well as a deficit

**Turns**

IWG - iran war good - Iran would be decimated and lose the ability to prolif, also shows global US strength which causes Russia and China to back off

High oil prices good - the link is that the plan floods global oil markets which drives prices down since Iran is a huge oil producer
Two impact modules
1 - Chinese FDI reliant on low oil prices - removing them causes China to intervene to protect trillions which risks a bigger conflict
2 - that one impact about Canada soft power
