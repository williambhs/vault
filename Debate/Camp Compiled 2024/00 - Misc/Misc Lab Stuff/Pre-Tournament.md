Going into a tournament - look at the entry list
Know who you would need to prep out - make a list of arguments they make on the aff/neg and develop strategies vs. each
For teams you are unlikely to beat - introduce randomness, ie. going for condo

Conversely - if you think you're going to win, introduce LESS randomness - one less cp = one less condo = less chance you get condo'd

Make a card doc vs each position ie. what cards you would read against the HR disad - same thing for the neg, what do you want to read on each advantage
