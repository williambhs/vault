For the 1AC/1NC:

Be assertive - sound like you want to win the debate, like you're passionate and correct
Use inflection - the judge isn't writing down everything you say so make sure they write down what's important rather than processing afterwards 
don't say "that's" before author names and "and" between cards - dead syllables

Don't pause for a long time between the tag and the card - no point because they don't need pen time to write down what you read in the card

Yell very loudly - maybe do endurance drills

2NR/2AR:
Be very loud in the overview - they need to write down your stuff
