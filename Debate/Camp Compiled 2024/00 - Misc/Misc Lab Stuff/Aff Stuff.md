If on refers to focus - only adds secondary sanctions aff on the three countries - if they say you can be like exclude sanctions on Iran that relate to Germany nearly all would mean you can't 

2AR to T-on - wtf does this mean or wtf does this mean = we meet
Aff meets the object - what is "the object" - ask in cx what is the object of the sanction
is it the country, the individual, the person - whatever answer they give is not supported by the card - proves their offense is not predictable
