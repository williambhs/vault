**how to win?**

1 - if you think you're gonna lose why should the judge think you're going to win
choose to be more focused and driven than anyone else on the circuit - set goals for yourself and as long as you've chosen to work harder/be more determined then attaining those goals is possible
see the value in achieving those goals - even if you don't win every debate
you are going to lose - recognize that being nervous and having preround anxiety is compatible with achieving the goals you've set out for

2 - expect to win - if a tournament ends Monday, plan to stay through Monday - if you are eliminated watch rounds anyways - recognize that there's always something to be learned from other people, even if you think they're worse than you 

3 - there shouldn't be anyone you're afraid to debate because you think they're better - you should be excited by challenging rounds and view them as an opportunity to show off your best debating - treat every debate like round one, don't let prior tournament performance dictate your performance in any given round - if you're down two or up all that shouldn't change how the debate in front of you plays out

**do's and don'ts for in round ethos:**

**do -** 
1 - when aff, get to the round early, set up the speechdrop or chain so when your opponent/judge is there you're good
2 - know the order before prep ends - project perceptual dominance - if the order is undecided projects unconfidence
3 - label your flows so if a position hasn't been named you should name it
4 - don't change the order mid speech - should be predecided before prep ends
5 - ask if everyone's ready once - then start
6 - write down how much prep you and your opponent have
7 - use a timer for their prep and speeches with a ringer
8 - have cx questions ready
9 - know what you read, know what your opponent read
10 - know what your cards say, make sure you pronounce your cards right
11 - sit farthest from the door
12 - flow the 2ar, even if you're neg - look like you're involved and that you're ready to call the judge out for mischaracterizing arguments
13 - take notes during the rfd
14 - be organized 

**don'ts -**
1 - be cringe and steal prep
2 - "judge" "my opponent"
3 - steal prep - very obvious 
4 - don't sit during speeches or cx

**tournament behavior -**
1 - look presentable - drink a bottle of water after every debate
2 - eat decently - a lot of protein - good for energy, also eat regularly
3 - start with spreading drills - first time you spread should never be the first speech
4 - work well with teammates (not like this matters for me)
5 - have a scouting system and work between rounds - prep should be accessible and it should be easy to find a doc from a debate you weren't in
6 - don't play disclosure games
7 - organize your wiki
8 - be flex, not predictable - you should never think "wow, this arg would go so hard but I can't go for it"
9 - tournaments are marathons, not sprints - even if you're mid if you're consistently mid that's better than someone who goes crazy in prelims but tosses elims
10 - focus on the process
