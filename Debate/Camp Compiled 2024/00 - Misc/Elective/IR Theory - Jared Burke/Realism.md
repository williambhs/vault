**Three key tenants to Realism:**

1 - States act in order to defend themselves to defend against other states
Excludes international organizations - used as tools to become more powerful
Don't play a major role in how we understand power
States perform cost-benefit analysis 
Assumes states act in rational means to halt conflict

2 - International systems are anarchic - states cannot rely on other states, means alliances fail - alliances can form but used to exert their power

3 - Self-help system - states can use international organizations to gain relative power - for example one of the way China rose to power was exploiting the LIO, like by joining the WTO 

**Security dilemma** - if there is a securitization of a region of the world - results in oversecuritization, draws in conflict
Useful to beat teams that don't understand how conflict works
Spiral model conflict - someone securitizes the region - the non securitizing state securitizes back, causes a feedback loop

As the non-k debater you want to argue there is no security dilemma - if realism is true states will act in rational manners and thus China will back off

**Two tenants of balance of Power Realism**

1 - sameness effect - rising power plays by the rules of the system of the dominant power - China's rise played by the rules of the LIO - led to debt-trap imperialism because Roosevelt did the same in the past - when there is a vacuum to fill for economic trading partner, China fills it

2 - bandwagoning - states align with the strongest state possible - countries bet on who will become the dominant hegemon in the international order - for example, the US has many alliances and thus can use NATO as a deterrent vs Russia - for example countries that are part of the BRI are "betting" on China to be the new hegemon 

Important because the US is declining, China is rising, and Russia is resurging


**Offensive Realism**

Believe there is no limit to how much power a state can have - explain China as an offensive realist as they are risk-accepting against the US
The main tenant of offensive realism to understand is that there is no limit to how much power a state can have

**Defensive Realism**

If there is an oversecuritization of a region - for example if the US has a high concentration of military power in the Persian Gulf, states such as Iran would strike the US as they feel threatened - another example is Russia invading Ukraine - NATO encircling Russia resulted in an encirclement of Russia, just before the Ukranian war Ukraine was going to join NATO but Ukraine has a rule where no states under war could join NATO - thus Russia went to war with Ukraine to prevent complete encirclement of the Russian state

Power transition theory - rising power challenges the dominant power
Tenants to revisionism/degrees to which revisionism exists - limited vs revolutionary revisionism

Risk-acceptant - willing to risk war

**Thucydides Trap**

Dominant powers will cling to power - seek preemptive conflict to try and strangle the baby in the bed - thus the US will cause conflict to stop a rising China
16 examples of power decline, 12 led to conflict - however important to note the 4 that didn't, 3 of the 4 were allies

IR scholars say deterrence is the reason US and USSR didn't go to war - but was also the closest the US ever was to a war with another major power
Also not to say there weren't proxy conflicts like Vietnam
