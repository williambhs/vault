Why is fairness valuable?
Turns debate into a coin toss of which side you're on - deprives debaters of the value and time they invest into the activity - it doesn't matter if debate is good - we have spent hours, time, and money preparing for the debate - that matters because every debater cares, we extend dropped arguments, judges are tech > truth, etc. 

Why is fairness strategic?
The most proximate to this round - the ballot can solve it
