T is a debate about what practices the community should develop - not an internal link to critical thinking

Clash - bigger impact than fairness - you have an external debate good impact (debating through a resolutional stasis point is good - turns you into a better advocate) as well as inroads into a lot of their offense

Go for fairness if they haven't said debate is bad - all their arguments are made in bad faith and demonstrates they link to their offense and everything is advanced through a competitive lens

Otherwise - fairness = external impact and clash is an internal link turn/even if statement

Can also go for clash exclusively - the process of debate is good (argument label is iteration)

Answering the affs offense:

1 - counterinterp debating - very important - explain why their interp specifically is unlimited and also bad for their offense or can't solve

2 - should put offense on their offensive arguments - changes based on the argument

neg loses these debates a lot as their ethos is all off - get off your blocks and think through/conceptualize their arguments
