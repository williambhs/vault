Most aff responses boil down to:
1 - t bad
2 - topical debates are bad

t bad is incoherent - it's an argument just like any other, just a negotiation/discussion of what the topic should mean - it's the same as counterplans proposing a countermodel or a disad that disagrees with the affs method - proves t is not a unique form of violence

**relatively comprehensive list of args teams make: (for t bad)**

1 - the ballot solves racist microagressions because they'll be less racist after voted down
no - 
a - debaters mald when they lose - makes them write better t blocks 
b - cruel optimism - a w on tabroom allows white judges to think they're doing something good and allows for the commodification of k affs 

2 - battle fatigue - wah wah i don't want to debate the topic because it's violent/i don't care (ie. talking about the state is violent)
causes battle fatigue in the real world - if we don't have meaningful debates we leave the activity with nothing 
no conceivable explanation of saying how "us should" causes psychic violence - voluntary competitive activity where you choose your level of commitment of travel 

3 - t excludes x group of people
a - exclusion inevitable - it does not say the content is not important - exclusion of content is also not exclusion of people - your model excludes other topics, ie. right to housing, military presence, etc. but it doesn't say they aren't important - similarly reading t doesn't say questions about things like antiblackness are unimportant
b - their interp excludes - brackets out evert x group debater that has to be neg - their interp also excludes content
c - logic is problematic - x group isn't a monolithic group of people that have the same political views - that's homogenizing - it's like saying all poc disagree with topicality 

4 - participation
straight turned by fairness - no one wants to participate in an unfair game

5 - racism in debate now, structural unfairness non-uqs
a - they can't solve - no reason reading the aff is going to suddenly change prep disparities
b - uniqueness for your procedural fairness argument

6 - respectability politics - your argument is that we should just be nicer - this assimilates us 
a - similar to policing - disagreement doesn't force you to do anything but is rather a negotiation of what should be best for debate
b - weaponizing respectability politics is bad - allows for violent ideologies based on social location
c - disagreement is valuable - that is the premise of clash - anything else results in echo chambers which kill clash

**at: topical debates bad**

some overview stuff:
1 - topical debates good - describe the topic - "clash debates happen under our model - aff says plan, neg says k, then we get in depth clash over whether or not neoliberalization is good or bad"

2 - our model solves the reason they say it's bad - ssd solves bad affs - if heg is so bad you should get better at beating to actualize it in the real world

3 - clash over a season solves - unethical arguments will lose

**extra args:**

1 - kvk debates are good
a - perm means the aff always wins - concessionary ground
b - clash of civs debates are better because they're more predictable, tied to a resolutional stasis and forces the neg to better defend their reps
c - t is good for kvk debates - possibility for the neg to go for t means the aff can't be infinitely shifty and - they don't solve limits explosion which means you don't get links

2 - policy debate bad
basically the same as topical debates bad - answered above 
also - assurance da makes us consider the interests of our asian allies instead of being american first, it's not like "wow us heg is the greatest thing ever"

3 - debate shapes subjectivities
a - read arguments we disagree with 
b - individual debates white noise - we forget what happens 

4 - k affs inevitable
winning k affs are bad is still a reason to vote neg...

5 - case outweighs
a - we don't exclude content - tva
b - their model doesn't solve - no reason their interp makes it more likely for debaters to engage
c - t is a procedural question

6 - legal definitions bad
matters for their offense - legal definitions are more accessible and predictable - means they link to our offense
also more accessible - their interp is gatekept by some random journal - if you ask someone what the res means they aren't going to say the us means "we the people"
