1ac - kant 
1nc - th - kant spec, nc - determinism
1ar - covered
2nr - determinism, case
2ar - covered


(advice for brian)
1ar should not be a race to the finish but rather to set up for the 2ar - generate offense
for example - concede presumption trigger and explain why presumption affirms

some shells people would read - for example nibs bad, converse theory, afc, etc.

for the 2nr - 
reverse pascals wager is an aff arg lmao don't say it if you don't have the card
explain determinism clearer

induction fails warrant - maybe the only reason I did a good thing is because my mom yelled at me and she only did it because her boss yelled at her - should phrase it differently - all things are based in the physical world - doesn't have much to do with induction, change the tag
should go deeper - the examples used of how everything is a causal link chain are oversimplifications - any situation can be understood as a sequence of steps - might be hidden causes into things but there are actually other motivations that influence what you're doing - might make you cranky/without being fully aware of the cause/outcomes of the choice 

kant wants to say he's able to avoid determinism - a mental realm where there are dreams and thoughts - they correspond with molecules in my brain but it's there's no physical realm in dreams - when you exist in a mental realm you can choose not to act on an impulsive - the person turning off the stove has limited information

from kant perspective - if I get into the front of line at starbucks - acting is deliberately moving your body - even if there are chemical transactions in your brain that make you act out impulsively, many times it's about feelings - Kant needs to guide action - the experience of living in the world is about consciousness and not moving in different ways - means it is applicable living in our everyday lives

no human beings - we are all in the first person point of view - the experience of living on earth is going through different things
even if it's true that determinism is true it doesn't feel that way which means you still need to make the decision to say what you're going to say - starbucks decision
the experience of living - experience of having to make choices
even if determinism is true - has nothing to do with human experience
phenomenology - about the way the world appears to us, not about the way the world is on a scientific level because science is unintuitive
