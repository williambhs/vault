1ac - iran 
1nc - da - terror, da - cred, cp - uq
1ar - covered
2nr - case
2ar - condo

Indict 1NC ev - otherwise 2NR will just be ahead in characterizing their i/l
Response to IWG - don't want to just say it fails and causes prolif - your argument is that prolif is inevitable in the status quo - means it's try or die 

You want to say the aff solves prolif - solves the ! turn

Contest the Taiwan war i/l

1AR vs China FDI/Canada is better - top of 1AR should be more comparative 

Word inefficient 

1AR vs UQ CP - CX can't say it's about Iran if it's about NoKo 
PDB shields the link to HR cred 

2AR - start with a more zoomed out o/v
lbl is pretty good

Different timeframe argument - the plan deescalates prolif immediately - solves the adv fast - try or die for diplomacy because they've made a uniqueness argument that says the US is going to first strike Iran - your argument should be first strike causes war (if Iran first strikes Iran, causes GPW) 
means it's try or die aff - only the plan solves prolif
argument about why first strike fails
