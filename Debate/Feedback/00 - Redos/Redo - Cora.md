Says try or die - not sufficiently explained
Only impact explained - heg collapse inevitable

If links have to be unique - the link is much smaller
Means you have to extend framework? (Ask Navya)

Explanation loses to perm double bind
Deliberalizes everywhere - perm would solve 

Lifting sanctions is certainly susceptible
Alt competes with the advantage

Be clear about why it's mutually exclusive 
Add a judge kick argument - we have a DA to the LIO

International Fiat argument doesn't make much sense
Eurocentrism - we focus on the US as the only actor

if the US does anti-imperialism that's sufficient - collapse of LIO solves links
case debate is fine

defense to korea prolif even though alt solves 
alt solves does not mean the status quo is good

to answer perm double bind:
links say the 1AC should be imperialist - answers double bind - tradeoff + mutually exclusive bc the alt is an ideology not an action

movement = a result in alignment with the ideology and not fiated

the link should be explained as a da to the perm - lio link is very good for this - promotes libertarianism sometimes, authoritarianism sometimes - that IS the perm 

explain the link on the perm - "the affs attempt to mix capitalism with liberal democracy creates an illiberal order"
