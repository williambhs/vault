Rhetorical missteps they have made - be very specific - start in the 1nc if you want - "the plan will lift a million people out of poverty" - assumes the only people that are suffering are rich people - income is lower than threshold - colonial definition of suffering 

Treaty arguments must be contextualized more to a living wage - choosing to accept a living wage is to accept a colonial way of life - working to a colonizer, forcing people to act in psychic self harm to benefit
