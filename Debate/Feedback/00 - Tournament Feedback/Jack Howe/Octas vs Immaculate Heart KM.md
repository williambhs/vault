no answer to reasonability besides new in the 2nr - not new to make reasonability arg but no c/i - no reason accessibility outweighs or matters - no reason phil ed matters - no impact - 2nr doesn't extend it so just impact it out

aff should get responses to their fw

dhruv - gave this less credence - not something i was immersed in in my short stint in ld - if you wanted to win this execute it perfectly - two pieces of terminal defense

conceded util in the 1ar - takes out the offense coupled with no real extension of why afc is drop the debater - can be dta - extended in the 2nr - even if not extended explicitly talks about differences - condo, pics, dtd, different levels of abuse - no reason for why afc is dtd 

no bl for what constitutes contestation - it's clear in this round - question of normsetting - may not be clear in other rounds - definitely goes unanswered - don't solve a lot of the 1ar answers

something you need to think about in future rounds 
why does no existence of afc means util and phil ed are u niquely lost - don't make sense because affs can read phil frameworks, kant, butler, etc. as long as negs can contest that - k affs other args solve pref
no afc does not take out phil debates - low risk of aff offense, reasonability
