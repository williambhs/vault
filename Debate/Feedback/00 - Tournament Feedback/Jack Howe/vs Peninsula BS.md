aff was asian 2nr was framework

performativity da means no clash impacts - also lacks turns case, impact calculus

2ar means this debate should be bracketed from others - fairness is different however

other impact - moral hazard - does it force identity negation - not evaluated - first is not in the 1nc - set up in cx but not in the speech until the 2nr - unclear what the impact is and how it outweighs the aff - begs the question of the affs offense

second argument is the mechanization da - 2nr answer is "this doesn't make sense because we have to defend a plan" - does not answer the argument

core thesis of the aff has been conceded - ahead on this question, means mechanization da also answers presumption - also irrelevant because straight turn debate - also impact turns procedural fairness

answering mechanization da - we think it is good that teams want to win - a model of debate that ensures equal footing to begin with ensures that is good

make a bigger deal of dropping case - uniqueness argument that controls framework - means we control thesis of how debates should operate around a living wage - impact turns clash because if we win a uq arguments if the scholastic space around wage contracts is predicated around violence there is only a risk that their model reproduces violence - means we control uq for neg offense - try or die 

very technical, pretty organized - good speech


at: performativity da - logical extent is "negs cant go for framework"
our argument is abstracting higher - inevitably a debate about model - the model question is just should the negative be able to go for topicality vs non t affs - means affs are wholely unconstrained - that means we have removed the only limit through removing topicality from debate

double bind - either they link to all ur offense or dont exclude any

procedural fairness - be very good on defense, hard to impact turn but easy to say other things outweigh it

1ar should develop aff straight turns framework more - if pushed back on it's gg - built to straight turn framework - set the framework debate up early, ie top of 2ac - toplevel ballot cannot universalize a model, it's a question of the reading of fw in this debate vs aff - it is not a neutral rule, it is a rhetorical trap that they have told you to invest in - impact turns are offense - if neg solves their offense we don't need to win we solve the aff, just that they solve theirs
