Neg's model more fair - resolves a lot of aff offense
nexus question - connection with the affs impacts and the ballot
couple crucial 2nr arguments not answered

framework is not coercive - doesn't force the aff to read particular arguments or perform in a particular way
neg shouldn't be burdened with rejoinder
answer - cross apply ballot key - debates under our model are good
extend the counterinterp 
helps a lot - what kind of debates, competition, etc matter

ballot can't solve framework, will just refine their blocks

fairness outweighs large fairness impact - no link defense - argument is yes competition, not the only thing relevant in debate
