1ac - postemory
2nr - cap

rfd:

the links on the cap k are predicated off the posturing of the 1ac
root cause arg
2ar says violence among asian bodies is based on labor 
root cause goes neg
doesn't understand why that flips root cause

links are das to the perm
proves the alt is competitive
refusing to engage in political engagement 

2ar - we don't reject all forms of politics - left wondering why the ballot matters

if state engagement is possible - why is the ballot important 

minimal risk of a link is enough
explain presumption
no link 

answers to framework not good - not sure if 1ac cx exemplifies those things 
have cards that talk about materiality - would act as good impact turns to framework - their model precludes the material actions that the aff is trying to implement
offense vs framework

when answering the cap k - better example of perm - have example of asian movements
