scott:
bigger risk that miscalc would occur because of loss of strategic stability than under the aff - not sure what the scenario is for the aff
what does the aff do? strategic stability scenario that us knowledge of where strikes are means they go first
ai defense has nothing to do with submarines - it's one of the ways the us might deter china 

better arg is theres no uq for the turn - china will just do it anyway - your scenario is about it being relatively similar

some risk of the nanotech ai grey goo stuff
impact turns ai - doesn't solve the internal link

should make a big deal out of the means card - tech is bad for miscalc 

need explanation of why deterrence posture necessary for the next couple of years

ben:
china is not revisionist - no risk of transition wars - 
a] status seeking - opium war
b] defensive realist
c] benefit from american led world order - get a ton of money from trade and stuff

from the aff - rivalries are hard to end - doesn't necessarily mean revisionism 
perhaps china not happy with the us but that doesn't mean they want to export their form of governance/undermine the us led world order

transition wars - neg ev better - talks about us retrenchment - aff needs to say past data doesn't account for new changes - tech, geopolitics, super different

aff does have impact defense to grey goo - "too hard to predict" - 1nc impact ev is pretty ass 
to answer innovation turn - say other countries will innovate - no reason the us is key - nuqs the turn - russia, eu, etc all might do it - means alt cause

1ar needs to do more lbl of revisionism
