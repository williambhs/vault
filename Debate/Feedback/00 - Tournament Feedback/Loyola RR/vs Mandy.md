1ac - healthcare
2nr - setcol

rfd:
2ar goes for a few arguments - framework
link in 2nr is to the consequence of the plan so weigh the case not necessary
try or die - only a risk of alt solvency
1ar link turn ev is like three lines long 
ev comparison is pretty good - link extension is about the process of which living wages result in new extraction policies
2ar lightfoot extension not the best
pdb - link argument - trades off

fw debate doesnt matter
only a risk the alt solves the link
link turn not contextual to the link

didnt think about ontology - but doesnt matter because collapse inevitable

if the aff says corporations bad because they tax a lot - means they cannot build pipelines - give money to workers - only a risk to material harm reduction can occur

would solve any residual offense
even if state is bad - theres only a risk that the aff could resolve the decline of the state

answering pdb - link arguments must be in the context of trading off of material decolonization - saps energy 

framework stuff is fine - to make it more devastating have super specific link arguments - read links to the adv - aff is western medicine good, why does that result in new forms of colonization - can still have topic link explanation but should be in addition to your k of medicine
