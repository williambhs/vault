cedric:
neg says we dont do anything
aff gets coopted by capitalism - good to engage in the state
we remain vulnerable
doesnt understand how the perm works
doesnt know when we organize 
aff pushes for revolution later
what is the endpoint for the aff
doesnt clarify when we have revolutionary organizing - how does solvency look
what does the perm look like
when do we start organizing after remembering our trauma

alt is the only method of organizing against violence 
not sure how you solve violence besides remembering trauma

what does the aff do. besides remember trauma - wouldve been super interesting as to how it helps represent asian americans

katie:
double bind - aff tries to no link by saying its not revolutionary
either its revolutionary and it links or its not and it cant solve
so just voted neg..??????
"a lot of words"


"what does the aff do?"
