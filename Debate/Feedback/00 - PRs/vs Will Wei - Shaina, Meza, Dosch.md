Danielle (aff) rfd:
voting on sanctions - worse - sets a bad norm because it is worse long-term - impact turns the only justification for competing interps - extended at the top of the 2AR and says reasonability is key 
2NR - big offense push is about topic education - the only thing intrinsic to debate - even if it's only resolutional spec - the link to terror disad isn't lost - aff specs all sanctions - generics check is more defense 
Allows for more topical clash 
neg has specific resolutional spec is good - sets better norms 
arguments about cx checks were already answered, extended, and dropped by the 1ar and the 2ar - not a substantial argument to non verifiable 
Spec is better for substantive debates in the future - doesn't cause arbitrariness - no apriori spec nonsense 

Questions:
2NR strategy tried to impact turn their model that's just broad clash - the impact to competing interps is we should talk about more specific things under the plantext
Answers to cx checks in the 2NR - doesn't matter?

To win it - have a better abuse story - explain very clearly about how you don't have the link
