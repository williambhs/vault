Framework - don't say anything
Missing an overview/theory of power - explain the Gonzales Vicente card well 
Good unsustainability warrants
Problem with link debating - doesn't assume perm do both
Link is to negotiations - not saying negotiations with NoKo are bad - saying neoliberal negotiations are bad - as long as the alt can shield the way the US can be hostile - we can do the plan of sanctions relief + do negotiations with noko to solve

Ways to answer it: 
Explain your alt as a disad to the plan - for example - "savior DA - the US' attempts to forefront North Korea in the context of market liberalization is bad"
liberalization is a violent process - explanation of Gonzalez Vicente will help

The IMF has conditionalities countries need to meet in order to get loans - directly correlated with negative health outcomes - entail privatization, led to a disparity of wealth and created income inequality problems - fueled populist agendas which is why we have illiberal countries now post transition since the USSR emerged in the way they have
Comparative advantage - as the US you might be able to create/manufacture everything like bananas better than Cuba, but you still might want to trade with Cuba as the opportunity cost of making one banana in the US = 3 almonds but in Cuba they might only have to sacrifice 1/2 of an almond, therefore the US should trade almonds for Cuba's bananas

Don't need to explain all of that but you do need to explain we force Global South to do "fuckshit" and enforce this upon them - we could not have sweatshops but we do because it's cheaper abroad, we make Global South countries be our manufactures for raw labor - prevents them from upward economic mobility - they might be wealthier as per neoliberal standards but income inequalities massively increases

Dutch disease - if a company is too specialized, like countries that export oil - when renewables come about they get left behind and any chance of economic upward mobility is shot

Sanctions would enforce this kind of trade - then say it's a DA to the aff not applicable to the alt as it does not liberalize North Korea by functionally deliberalizing everything else

Even if they want this Taiwan - it's peaceful
Need better answer to Terzi

The way you should explain the impact - 
We've made colonized societies our source of primary product and exploited labor - this decreases investment and economic diversification in those countries which means they can never develop - this is the way the self-correcting nature of liberalism is able to sustain itself

Tension between first and second advantage (explained yesterday)
We need to cooperate with NoKo!!! But we need to deter a trilateral axis from ever forming and contain them

If aff - say trilateral axis impact turns the kritik 
Explain why China is or isn't revisionist - century of humiliation could warrant both revisionism and China being a defensive realism
