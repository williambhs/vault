"pretty good"
when doing impact calc at the top weigh between the pics standard - don't just weigh between overlimiting but rather weigh between internal links

don't point out they didn't read precision
when responding to definition - plurality has two definitions

1 - majority of sanctions - they haven't met because they haven't proven oil is a majority of sanctions - 1nc violation says they are just 1/9th of sanctions at most which is obviously not the majority 

2 - if plurality means more than 1 - they link to all your limits offense 

redo:

all or nearly all - tiny pics don't negate on this topic - lose to pdcp
their interp allows targeted sanctions aff per country - include more examples of how we don't limit the topic - example of military presence of people breaking new affs over and over again - doesn't really ake sense 

explanation of plurality good
solvency deficit argument doesn't make enough sense 

explain functional limits better - if they can write an aff for 1/9 of sanctions which means it's not infinite affs in a vacuum but rather you know there is in depth literature on 9 x 3 = 27 affirmatives

in the overview - overlimiting worse than underlimiting

Kritik redo

Better explain fairness bad - unfairness inevitable is not a reason that fairness is bad 
Win that what they've done is so bad - punish them 

Framework + risk of a link instead of framework as your link - means you can still extend a link argument 
Win that policy debate is so morally bankrupt - the impact turn you should go for is that the explanation of what they are doing in the 1AR of going for plan focus is so so so bad
