1ac - setcol
1nc - k - semiocap, nc - skep
2nr - case (setcol link turn)

----

efficient - well structured
get the argument fast - implicated clearly - enjoyed
"do i really care about what the 2ar has to do if the 2nr has already written my ballot"
1nc strategy was very fun - "slowly working on it"
semiocap is cool!

pnp kicking - a little long
toplevel - 15-20s was fine

kicking out of skep was fine
