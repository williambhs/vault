shannon ev answers a majority of the case 
timeframe deficits don't matter or the impact
funding for workers plank solves but tiny da doesn't outweigh

borgas - 2ar and 2nr are making the same claim - middle class is poor -> prolif 
if the cp can solve - any risk sanctions are good = vote negative
funds the resistance - solves the middle class - increases economic power - limits the power while also limiting the upper class by auditing planks
timeframe deficit did matter - if Iran can proliferate in weeks - then the cp is a deficit to the aff - the cp funds these movements directly - solves prolif

enforcement cp - prolif is inevitable - moving towards nukes now - even if the cp gets more nukes - doesn't push them to build nukes if they have sanctions
cp makes it harder for them to get nukes in that time 
only internal regime change works - even if natural regime change has less resistance - cp still resolves that
uq cp says sanctions don't work now - adv cp solves - any risk of deterrence da = vote neg
funding controls the key warrant - middle class uprising is key to iranian regime change

2ar deficit is timeframe - dropped answers
enforcement induces nuclearization 
2nr is very light on deterrence - a very small risk of deterrence - not a great 2ar response 

2ar perception argument underexplained - gave up on sorting things
a lot of the 2ar does not implicate arguments - could've gone the other way if 2ar had better implication
