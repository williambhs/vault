Link says the consequence of the plan destroys the Iranian resistance economy - means framework does not matter - better judge instruction

JB Extension:
Globalization is manufacturing a crisis of neoliberalism - the rise of populism has liberal elites alarmed as Trump, Xi, Kim have all come to power with the process of spewing anti-globalization propaganda. The liberal elites are attempting to utilize economic liberalization and normalization as strategies to halt the spread of populism but they have failed to realize that those strategies create a self fulfilling prophecy where social dislocation and economic distancing become inevitable. Trump did this as he preyed on utilizing xenophobic rhetoric and became the leading example of rising right-wing anti-globalization.

Link debate should be framed through history - the aff replicates the process of Iranian coup-making the US did - worked for a while but lated resulted in populists coming to power - even in the interim, OPEC could not sell oil/gas - still conflicts in the interim - all have risks of escalating - height of the cold war
