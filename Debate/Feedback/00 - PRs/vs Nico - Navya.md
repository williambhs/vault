1ac - venezuela
1nc - da - oil, da - hr, t - nearly all
1ar - covered
2nr - t - nearly all
2ar - covered

1AR should give a countermodel for probability x magnitude - instead use natural log of magnitude - diminishing result of magnitude as it gets higher but you don't just reject it - higher tax on magnitude for impact calc = non-arbitrary
most of your arguments are that tradeoffs are unethical

"is it ethical to kill 1 terrorist a day to save 500 babies"
"they are anti-hr propaganda" - indict their sources - many authors are paid off and work for policy institutes - right wing groups that have an interest in suppressing hr
you should say their authors are structurally biased

advantage
ok arguments
not assuming the best of their case arguments - maduro = root cause 
have a reason why sanctions -> diplomacy - even if not perfect would still be a benefit

need to say more about the deterrence da - why the costs link argument is wrong
straight turn HR da

topicality
say reasonability
start some ev comparison in 1ar maybe


2AR on T feedback
go for arbitrariness instead of pics
missing the boat - if no ones writing about cyber sanctions - we can't write an aff but you can't get a pic
bad nbs lose to deficit
concede affs are based on broader shifts of foreign policy 

still answer precision - precise limits should be the gold standard 
insert qpq solvency advocates or maybe send in the 2ar to prove that they get links

answer their prep burdens about how case neg is harder
precision o/ws - 2nr did no ev comparison - means our i/l to precision is much greater than their impact to limits - even a small impact to precision o/ws because the i/l differential is massive

their interp justifies counterinterp just our aff - the cult of limits is always able to generate a risk of your aff being hard to debate - also kills aff innovation and kills fairness 
almost all = 90% has nothing to do with government related policy 
not authoritative and one that they've randomly picked 
plurality = relative majority
c/i solves limit explosion - only allows for affs about the greatest relative part of sanctions - ensures geopolitical relevance
no solvency advocates for all the garbage they've listed
only our interp defines nearly all - theirs defines almost all

deterrence - explain links as being perception based
ensures links to das - hr cred, deterrence both say engaging with authoritarian leaders is bad

2ar - say arbitrary interps are bad for the aff - explain why precision o/ws limits - say their interp is not sufficiently predictable to vote neg on topicality
only the c/i is - their interp is cult of limits, entirely arbitrary, can always win a risk of offense
answer how nearly all modifies sanctions means you meet your counterinterp
precision 2ars - ethos a big thing about it - win their interp is contrived nonsense
